## Setup

You must have a recent version of Node.js (22+) installed. You may use [Volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta), a Node version manager, to install the latest version of Node and `npm`, which is a package manager that is included with `node`'s installation.

```sh
$ curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
$ volta install node@22
```

Install the Node.js dependencies for this project using npm or another package manager:

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Development

When making changes to the site, including any content changes, you may run a local development server by running the following command:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

This spawns a server that will be accessible via `http://localhost:4321` in your browser. Additionally, any changes made within the project â€“ including `content/**` changes â€“ will automatically reload your browser tab(s), allowing you to instantly preview your changes.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                      |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `npx astro build`         | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                |
