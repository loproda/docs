If you are running a version of Wrangler that is greater than `3.66.0` but below `4.0.0`, you will need to include the `--experimental-include-runtime` flag. During its experimental release, runtime types were output to a separate file (`.wrangler/types/runtime.d.ts` by default). If you have an older version of Wrangler, you can access runtime types through the `@cloudflare/workers-types` package.
