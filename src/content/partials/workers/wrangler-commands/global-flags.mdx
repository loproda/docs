import { Type } from "~/components";

The following global flags work on every command:

- `--help` <Type text="boolean" />
  - Show help.
- `--config` <Type text="string" /> (not supported by Pages)
  - Path to your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
- `--cwd` <Type text="string" />
  - Run as if Wrangler was started in the specified directory instead of the current working directory.
