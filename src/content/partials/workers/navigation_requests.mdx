### Navigation requests

If you have a Worker script (`main`), have configured `assets.not_found_handling`, and use the [`assets_navigation_prefers_asset_serving` compatibility flag](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#navigation-requests-prefer-asset-serving) (or set a compatibility date of `2025-04-01` or greater), _navigation requests_ will not invoke the Worker script. A _navigation request_ is a request made with the `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate` header, which browsers automatically attach when navigating to a page. This reduces billable invocations of your Worker script, and is particularly useful for client-heavy applications which would otherwise invoke your Worker script very frequently and unnecessarily.

:::note
This can lead to surprising but intentional behavior. For example, if you define an API endpoint in a Worker script (e.g. `/api/date`) and then fetch it with a client-side request in your SPA (e.g. `fetch("/api/date")`), the Worker script will be invoked and your API response will be returned as expected. However, if you navigate to `/api/date` in your browser, you will be served an HTML file. Again, this is to reduce the number of billable invocations for your application while still maintaining SPA-like functionality. This behavior can be disabled by setting the [`assets_navigation_has_no_effect` compatibility flag](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#navigation-requests-prefer-asset-serving).
:::

:::note
If you wish to run the Worker script ahead of serving static assets (e.g. to log requests, or perform some authentication checks), you can additionally configure the [`assets.run_worker_first` setting](/workers/static-assets/routing/worker-script/#run_worker_first). This will retain your `assets.not_found_handling` behavior when no other asset matches, while still allowing you to control access to your application with your Worker script.

#### Client-side callbacks

In some cases, you might need to pass a value from a navigation request to your Worker script. For example, if you are acting as an OAuth callback, you might expect to see requests made to some route such as `/oauth/callback?code=...`. With the `assets_navigation_prefers_asset_serving` flag, your HTML assets will be server, rather than your Worker script. In this case, we recommend, either as part of your client application for this appropriate route, or with a slimmed-down endpoint-specific HTML file, passing the value to the server with client-side JavaScript.

```html title="./dist/oauth/callback.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>OAuth callback</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Loading...</p>
		<script>
			(async () => {
				const response = await fetch("/api/oauth/callback" + window.location.search);
				if (response.ok) {
					window.location.href = '/';
				} else {
					document.querySelector('p').textContent = 'Error: ' + (await response.json()).error;
				}
			})();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

<TypeScriptExample filename="./worker/index.ts">

```ts
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
	async fetch(request: Request) {
		const url = new URL(request.url);
		if (url.pathname === "/api/oauth/callback") {
			const code = url.searchParams.get("code");

			const sessionId = await exchangeAuthorizationCodeForAccessAndRefreshTokensAndPersistToDatabaseAndGetSessionId(code);

			if (sessionId) {
				return new Response(null, {
					headers: {
						"Set-Cookie": `sessionId=${sessionId}; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Secure; Path=/; Max-Age=86400`,
					},
				});
			} else {
				return Response.json(
					{ error: "Invalid OAuth code. Please try again." },
					{ status: 400 }
				);
			}
		}

		return new Response(null, { status: 404 });
	}
}
```
