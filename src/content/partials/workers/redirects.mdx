To apply custom redirects on {props.product === 'workers' ? 'a Worker with static assets' : 'Cloudflare Pages'}, declare your redirects in a plain text file called `_redirects` without a file extension, in the static asset directory of your project. This file will not itself be served as a static asset, but will instead be parsed by {props.product === 'workers' ? 'Workers' : 'Cloudflare Pages'} and its rules will be applied to static asset responses.

<Render
	product="workers"
	file="headers_redirects_directory"
	params={{ filename: "_redirects", product: props.product }}
/>

:::caution

Redirects defined in the `_redirects` file are not applied to requests served by {props.product === 'workers' ? <>your Worker code, even if the request URL matches a rule defined in <code>{/* prettier-ignore-start */}_redirects{/* prettier-ignore-end */}</code>. You may wish to apply redirects manually in your Worker code, or explore other options such as <a href="/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/create-dashboard/">Bulk Redirects</a></> : <><a href="/pages/functions/">Pages Functions</a>, even if the Function route matches the URL pattern. If your Pages application uses Functions, you must migrate any behaviors from the <code>{/* prettier-ignore-start */}_redirects{/* prettier-ignore-end */}</code> file to the code in the appropriate <code>/functions</code> route, or <a href="/pages/functions/routing/#create-a-_routesjson-file">exclude the route from Functions</a></>}.

## Structure

### Per line

Only one redirect can be defined per line and must follow this format, otherwise it will be ignored.

```txt
[source] [destination] [code?]
```

- `source` <Type text="string" /> <MetaInfo text="required" />

  - A file path.
  - Can include [wildcards (`*`)](#splats) and [placeholders](#placeholders).
  - Because fragments are evaluated by your browser and not Cloudflare's network, any fragments in the source are not evaluated.

- `destination` <Type text="string" /> <MetaInfo text="required" />

  - A file path or external link.
  - Can include fragments, query strings, [splats](#splats), and [placeholders](#placeholders).

- `code` <Type text="number" /> <MetaInfo text="(default: 302) optional" />

  - Optional parameter

Lines starting with a `#` will be treated as comments.

### Per file

A `_redirects` file is limited to 2,000 static redirects and 100 dynamic redirects, for a combined total of 2,100 redirects. Each redirect declaration has a 1,000-character limit.

In your `_redirects` file:

- The order of your redirects matter. If there are multiple redirects for the same `source` path, the top-most redirect is applied.
- Static redirects should appear before dynamic redirects.
- Redirects are always followed, regardless of whether or not an asset matches the incoming request.

A complete example with multiple redirects may look like the following:

```txt
/home301 / 301
/home302 / 302
/querystrings /?query=string 301
/twitch https://twitch.tv
/trailing /trailing/ 301
/notrailing/ /nottrailing 301
/page/ /page2/#fragment 301
/blog/* https://blog.my.domain/:splat
/products/:code/:name /products?code=:code&name=:name
```

## Advanced redirects

Cloudflare currently offers limited support for advanced redirects.

## Redirects and header matching

Redirects execute before headers, so in the case of a request matching rules in both files, the redirect will win out.

### Splats

On matching, a splat (asterisk, `*`) will greedily match all characters. You may only include a single splat in the URL.

The matched value can be used in the redirect location with `:splat`.

### Placeholders

<Render
	product="workers"
	file="headers_redirects_placeholders"
	params={{ filetype: "redirect" }}
/>

```txt
/movies/:title /media/:title
```

### Proxying

Proxying will only support relative URLs on your site. You cannot proxy external domains.

Only the first redirect in your will apply. For example, in the following example, a request to `/a` will render `/b`, and a request to `/b` will render `/c`, but `/a` will not render `/c`.

```
/a /b 200
/b /c 200
```

:::note

Be aware that proxying pages can have an adverse effect on search engine optimization (SEO). Search engines often penalize websites that serve duplicate content. Consider adding a `Link` HTTP header which informs search engines of the canonical source of content.

For example, if you have added `/about/faq/* /about/faqs 200` to your `_redirects` file, you may want to add the following to your `_headers` file:

```txt
/about/faq/*
  Link: </about/faqs>; rel="canonical"
```

## Surpass `_redirects` limits

A <a href={props.product === 'workers' ? '/workers/platform/limits/#redirects' : '/pages/platform/limits/#redirects'}>`_redirects`</a> file has a maximum of 2,000 static redirects and 100 dynamic redirects, for a combined total of 2,100 redirects. Use [Bulk Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/) to handle redirects that surpasses the 2,100 redirect rules limit of `_redirects`.

:::note

The redirects defined in the `_redirects` file of your build folder can work together with your Bulk Redirects. In case of duplicates, Bulk Redirects will run in front of your {props.product === 'workers' ? 'Worker' : 'Pages project'}, where your other redirects live.

For example, if you have Bulk Redirects set up to direct `abc.com` to `xyz.com` but also have `_redirects` set up to direct `xyz.com` to `foo.com`, a request for `abc.com` will eventually redirect to `foo.com`.
