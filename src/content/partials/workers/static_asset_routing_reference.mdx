### Reference

In most cases, configuring `assets.not_found_handling` to <code>{props.not_found_handling}</code> will provide the desired behavior. If you are building your own framework, or have specialized needs, the following diagram can provide insight into exactly how the routing decisions are made.

Requests are only billable if a Worker script is invoked. From there, it is possible to serve assets using the assets binding (depicted as the dotted line in the diagram above).

{props.not_found_handling === "single-page-application" ? "Although unlikely to impact how a SPA is served, you" : "You"} can read more about how we match assets in the [HTML handling docs](/workers/static-assets/routing/advanced/html-handling/).
