:::caution[Use Workers Static Assets Instead]

You should use [Workers Static Assets](/workers/static-assets/) to host full-stack applications instead of Workers Sites. It has been deprecated in Wrangler v4, and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/) does not support Workers Sites. Do not use Workers Sites for new projects.
