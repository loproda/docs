### How much work can a single Durable Object do?

Durable Objects can scale horizontally across many Durable Objects. Each individual Object is inherently single-threaded.

- An individual Object has a soft limit of 1,000 requests per second. You can have an unlimited number of individual objects per namespace.
- A simple [storage](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/) `get()` on a small value that directly returns the response may realize a higher request throughput compared to a Durable Object that (for example) serializes and/or deserializes large JSON values.
- Similarly, a Durable Object that performs multiple `list()` operations may be more limited in terms of request throughput.

A Durable Object that receives too many requests will, after attempting to queue them, return an [overloaded](/durable-objects/observability/troubleshooting/#durable-object-is-overloaded) error to the caller.

### How many Durable Objects can I create?

Durable Objects are designed such that the number of individual objects in the system do not need to be limited, and can scale horizontally.

- You can create and run as many separate Durable Objects as you want within a given Durable Object <GlossaryTooltip term="namespace">namespace</GlossaryTooltip>.
- There are no limits for storage per account when using SQLite-backed Durable Objects on a Workers Paid plan.
- Each SQLite-backed Durable Object has a storage limit of 10 GB on a Workers Paid plan.
- Refer to [Durable Object limits](/durable-objects/platform/limits/) for more information.

### Can I increase Durable Objects' CPU limit?

Durable Objects are Worker scripts, and have the same [per invocation CPU limits](/workers/platform/limits/#worker-limits) as any Workers do. Note that CPU time is active processing time: not time spent waiting on network requests, storage calls, or other general I/O, which don't count towards your CPU time or Durable Objects compute consumption.

By default, the maximum CPU time per Durable Objects invocation (HTTP request, WebSocket message, or Alarm) is set to 30 seconds, but can be increased for all Durable Objects associated with a Durable Object definition by setting `limits.cpu_ms` in your Wrangler configuration:

<WranglerConfig>

```jsonc
{
  // ...rest of your configuration...
  "limits": {
    "cpu_ms": 300000, // 300,000 milliseconds = 5 minutes
  },
  // ...rest of your configuration...
}
```

</WranglerConfig>
