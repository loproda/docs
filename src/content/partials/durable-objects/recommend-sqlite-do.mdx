:::note[Recommended SQLite-backed Durable Objects]
Cloudflare recommends all new Durable Object namespaces use the [SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#create-sqlite-backed-durable-object-class). These Durable Objects can continue to use storage [key-value API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#kv-api).

Additionally, SQLite-backed Durable Objects allow you to store more types of data (such as tables), and offers Point In Time Recovery API which can restore a Durable Object's embedded SQLite database contents (both SQL data and key-value data) to any point in the past 30 days.

The [key-value storage backend](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/#create-durable-object-class-with-key-value-storage) remains for backwards compatibility, and a migration path from KV storage backend to SQLite storage backend for existing Durable Object namespaces will be available in the future.
