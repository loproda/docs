Ensure that your operating system allows notifications for WARP. Your device may not display notifications if focus, do not disturb, or screen sharing settings are turned on. To turn on client notifications on macOS devices running DisplayLink software, you may have to allow system notifications when mirroring your display. For more information, refer to the [macOS documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-notifications-settings-mh40583/mac).
