Cloudflare Zero Trust can integrate with {props.one} to require that users connect to certain applications from managed devices. This service-to-service posture check uses the WARP client to read endpoint data from {props.one}. Devices are identified by their serial numbers. If multiple devices have the same serial number, Cloudflare cannot accurately match a WARP device with a third-party provider device. You must ensure that each of your devices has a unique serial number.
