When using Access self-hosted applications, the majority of Cloudflare products will be compatible with your application.

However, the following products are not supported:

* [Automatic Signed Exchanges](/speed/optimization/other/signed-exchanges/)
* [Automatic Platform Optimization](/automatic-platform-optimization)
* [Zaraz](/zaraz)

You can disable Automatic Signed Exchanges and Zaraz for a specific application - instead of across your entire zone - using a [Configuration Rule](/rules/configuration-rules/) scoped to the application domain.
