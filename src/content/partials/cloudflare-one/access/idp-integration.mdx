1. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):

2. Add an identity provider to Zero Trust using the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_access_identity_provider`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_access_identity_provider) resource. For example, to add a Microsoft Entra ID integration:

		<Render file="access/entra-id-terraform" product="cloudflare-one" />

		Each identity provider integration has different required attributes. You will need to obtain these attribute values from your identity provider. For more information, refer to the [IdP-specific documentation](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/).
