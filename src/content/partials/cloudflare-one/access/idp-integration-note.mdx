If you do not see your identity provider listed, these providers can typically still be enabled. If they support OIDC or OAuth, {props.verb} the [generic OIDC](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/generic-oidc/) option. If they support SAML, {props.verb} the [generic SAML](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/generic-saml/) option. Cloudflare supports all SAML and OIDC providers and can integrate with the majority of OAuth providers. If your provider supports both SAML and OIDC, we recommend OIDC for ease of configuration.
