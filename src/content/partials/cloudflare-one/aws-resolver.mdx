Avoid configuring your [Local Domain Fallback](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/) or [Resolver Policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/resolver-policies/) to direct all `*.amazonaws.com` DNS resolution via AWS Route 53 Resolver.

Some AWS endpoints (such as `ssm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`) are public AWS endpoints that are not resolvable via internal VPC resolution. This can break AWS Console features for users on WARP.

Only route specific Route 53 zones, or VPC Endpoints (such as `vpce.amazonaws.com`), through the internal VPC resolver.
