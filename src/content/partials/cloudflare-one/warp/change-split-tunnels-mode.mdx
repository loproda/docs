1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
2. Under **Device settings**, locate the [device profile](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/) you would like to modify and select **Configure**.
3. Scroll down to **Split Tunnels**.
4. (Optional) To view your existing Split Tunnel configuration, select **Manage**. You will see a list of the IPs and domains Cloudflare Zero Trust excludes or includes, depending on the mode you have selected. We recommend making a copy of your Split Tunnel entries, as they will revert to the default upon switching modes.
5. Under **Split Tunnels**, choose a mode:
   - **Exclude IPs and domains** — (Default) All traffic will be sent to Cloudflare Gateway except for the IPs and domains you specify.
   - **Include IPs and Domains** — Only traffic destined to the IPs or domains you specify will be sent to Cloudflare Gateway. All other traffic will bypass Gateway and will no longer be filtered by your network or HTTP policies. In order to use certain features, you will need to manually add [Zero Trust domains](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#cloudflare-zero-trust-domains).

</TabItem> <TabItem label="Terraform (v5)">

1. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Zero Trust Write`

2. Choose a [`cloudflare_zero_trust_device_default_profile`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_device_default_profile) or [`cloudflare_zero_trust_device_custom_profile`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_device_custom_profile) resource to modify, or [create a new device profile](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/#create-a-new-profile).

3. In your device profile, configure either the `exclude` or `include` argument. You cannot set both `exclude` and `include` in a given device profile.

	a. To manage Split Tunnel routes in **Exclude** mode, use the `exclude` argument:

		```tf
		resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_device_custom_profile" "exclude_example" {
			account_id            = var.cloudflare_account_id
			name                  = "Custom profile in Split Tunnels Exclude mode"
			enabled               = true
			precedence            = 101
			service_mode_v2       = {mode = "warp"}
			match 								=  "identity.email == \"test@cloudflare.com\""

			exclude = [{
					address = "10.0.0.0/8"
					description = "Example route to exclude from WARP tunnel"
			}]
		}
		```

		In this example, all traffic will be sent to Cloudflare Gateway except for traffic destined to `10.0.0.0/8`. To exclude the default IPs and domains recommended by Cloudflare, refer to [Add a route](#add-a-route).

	b. To manage Split Tunnel routes in **Include** mode, use the `include` argument:

		```tf
		resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_device_custom_profile" "include_example" {
			account_id            = var.cloudflare_account_id
			name                  = "Custom profile in Split Tunnels Include mode"
			enabled               = true
			precedence            = 101
			service_mode_v2       = {mode = "warp"}
			match 								=  "identity.email == \"test@cloudflare.com\""

			include = [{
					address = "10.0.0.0/8"
					description = "Example route to include in WARP tunnel"
			}]
		}
		```

		In this example, only traffic destined to `10.0.0.0/8` will be sent to Cloudflare Gateway.

All clients with this device profile will now switch to the new mode and its default route configuration. Next, [add](#add-a-route) or [remove](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#remove-a-route) routes from your Split Tunnel configuration.
