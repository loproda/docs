1. [Create a service token](/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/#create-a-service-token).

2. Copy the token's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

3. Go to **Access** > **Policies** and create the following policy:

   | Rule Action  | Rule type | Selector      | Value          |
   | ------------ | --------- | ------------- | -------------- |
   | Service Auth | Include   | Service Token | `<TOKEN-NAME>` |

		 Make sure to set **Action** to _Service Auth_ instead of _Allow_.
4. Add the Access policy to your [device enrollment permissions](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/device-enrollment/#set-device-enrollment-permissions).
5. In your MDM [deployment parameters](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/), add the following fields:
   * `auth_client_id`: The **Client ID** of your service token.
   * `auth_client_secret`: The **Client Secret** of your service token.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="Terraform (v5)">

1. Add the following permissions to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Access: Apps and Policies Write`
	- `Access: Service Tokens Write`

2. [Create a service token](/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/#create-a-service-token) and copy its **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

3. Create the following Access policy:

	```tf
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_access_policy" "warp_enrollment_service_token" {
		account_id     = var.cloudflare_account_id
		name           = "Allow service token"
		decision       = "non_identity"
		include = [
			{
				service_token = {
					token_id = cloudflare_zero_trust_access_service_token.example_service_token.id
				}
			}
		]
	}
	```
4. Add the policy to your [`cloudflared_zero_trust_access_application` for WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/device-enrollment/#set-device-enrollment-permissions).

5. In your MDM [deployment parameters](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/), add the following fields:
   * `auth_client_id`: The **Client ID** of your service token.
   * `auth_client_secret`: The **Client Secret** of your service token.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

When you deploy the WARP client with your MDM provider, WARP will automatically connect the device to your Zero Trust organization.
