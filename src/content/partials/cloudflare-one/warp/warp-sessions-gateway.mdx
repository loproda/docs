You can enforce WARP session timeouts on any Gateway Network and HTTP policy that has an Allow action. If you do not specify a session timeout, the WARP session will be unlimited by default.

Session timeouts have no impact on Gateway DNS policies. DNS policies remain active even when a user needs to re-authenticate.

To configure a session timeout for a Gateway policy:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to either **Gateway** > **Firewall Policies**. Choose either **Network** or **HTTP**.
2. Add a policy and select the *Allow* action. Alternatively, choose any existing *Allow* policy.
3. Under **Step 4 - Configure policy settings**, select **Edit** next to **Enforce WARP client session duration**.
4. Enter a session expiration time in `1h30m0s` format and save.
5. Save the policy.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform (v5)">

1. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Zero Trust Write`

2. Choose a Network (`l4`) or HTTP (`http`) policy with an Allow action.

3. In the policy's [`rule_settings`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_gateway_policy), use the `check_session` argument to enable and configure a session timeout:

	```tf
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_policy" "network_allow_wiki_IPs" {
		name        = "Company Wiki Network policy"
		enabled     = true
		account_id  = var.cloudflare_account_id
		description = "Managed by Terraform - Allow employees to access company wiki IPs."
		precedence  = 103
		action      = "allow"
		filters     = ["l4"]
		traffic     = "net.dst.ip in ${"$"}${cloudflare_zero_trust_list.wiki_IPs.id}"
		identity    = "identity.email matches \".*@example.com\""

		rule_settings = {
			check_session = {
				enforce = true
				duration = "1h30m0s"
			}
		}
	}
	```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Session checks are now enabled for the application protected by this policy. Users can continue to reach applications outside of the policy definition.
