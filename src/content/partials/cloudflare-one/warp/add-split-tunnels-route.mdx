<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
2. Under **Device settings**, locate the [device profile](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/) you would like to modify and select **Configure**.
3. Under **Split Tunnels**, check whether your [Split Tunnels mode](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#change-split-tunnels-mode) is set to **Exclude** or **Include**.
4. Select **Manage**.
5. You can exclude or include routes based on either their IP address or domain. When possible we recommend adding an IP address instead of a domain. To learn about the consequences of adding a domain, refer to [Domain-based Split Tunnels](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#domain-based-split-tunnels).

		<Tabs> <TabItem label="Add an IP">

		To add an IP address to Split Tunnels:

		1. Select _IP Address_.
		2. Enter the IP address or <GlossaryTooltip term="CIDR">CIDR</GlossaryTooltip> you want to exclude or include.
		3. Select **Save destination**.

		Traffic to this IP address is now excluded or included from the WARP tunnel.

		</TabItem> <TabItem label="Add a domain">

		To add a domain to Split Tunnels:

		1. Select _Domain_.
		2. Enter a [valid domain](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#valid-domains) to exclude or include.
		3. Select **Save destination**.
		4. (Optional) If your domain does not have a public DNS record, create a [Local Domain Fallback](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/) entry to allow a private DNS server to handle domain resolution.

		When a user goes to the domain, the domain gets resolved according to your Local Domain Fallback configuration (either by Gateway or by your private DNS server). WARP Split Tunnels will then dynamically include or exclude the IP address returned in the DNS lookup.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="Terraform (v5)">

1. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Zero Trust Write`

2. Choose a [`cloudflare_zero_trust_device_default_profile`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_device_default_profile) or [`cloudflare_zero_trust_device_custom_profile`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_device_custom_profile) resource to modify, or [create a new device profile](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/#create-a-new-profile).

3. (Optional) Create a list of split tunnel routes that you can reuse across multiple device profiles. For example, you can declare a local value in the same module as your device profiles:

	```tf title="split-tunnels.local.tf"
	locals {
		global_exclude_list = [
			# Default Split Tunnel entries recommended by Cloudflare
			{
				address     = "ff05::/16"
			},
			{
				address     = "ff04::/16"
			},
			{
				address     = "ff03::/16"
			},
			{
				address     = "ff02::/16"
			},
			{
				address     = "ff01::/16"
			},
			{
				address     = "fe80::/10"
				description = "IPv6 Link Local"
			},
			{
				address     = "fd00::/8"
			},
			{
				address     = "255.255.255.255/32"
				description = "DHCP Broadcast"
			},
			{
				address     = "240.0.0.0/4"
			},
			{
				address     = "224.0.0.0/24"
			},
			{
				address     = "192.168.0.0/16"
			},
			{
				address     = "192.0.0.0/24"
			},
			{
				address     = "172.16.0.0/12"
			},
			{
				address     = "169.254.0.0/16"
				description = "DHCP Unspecified"
			},
			{
				address     = "100.64.0.0/10"
			},
			{
				address     = "10.0.0.0/8"
			}
		]
	}
	```
4. In the device profile, exclude or include routes based on either their IP address or domain:

	```tf title="device-profiles.tf"
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_device_custom_profile" "example" {
		account_id            = var.cloudflare_account_id
		name                  = "Example custom profile with split tunnels"
		enabled               = true
		precedence            = 101
		service_mode_v2       = {mode = "warp"}
		match                 =  "identity.email == \"test@cloudflare.com\""

		exclude = concat(
			# Global entries
			local.global_exclude_list,

			# Profile-specific entries
			[
				{
					address = "192.0.2.0/24"
					description = "Example IP to exclude from WARP"
				},
				{
					host = "example.com"
					description = "Example domain to exclude from WARP"
				}
			]
		)
	}
	```
	 When possible we recommend adding an IP address instead of a domain. To learn about the consequences of adding a domain, refer to [Domain-based Split Tunnels](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#domain-based-split-tunnels).

<Render file="warp/client-notification-lag" product="cloudflare-one" />

We recommend keeping the Split Tunnels list short, as each entry takes time for the client to parse. In particular, domains are slower to action than IP addresses because they require on-the-fly IP lookups and routing table / local firewall changes. A shorter list will also make it easier to understand and debug your configuration. For information on device profile limits, refer to [Account limits](/cloudflare-one/account-limits/#warp).
