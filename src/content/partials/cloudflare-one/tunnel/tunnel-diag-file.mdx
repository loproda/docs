The `cloudflared-diag-YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm-ss.zip` archive contains the files listed below. The data in a file either applies to the `cloudflared` instance being diagnosed (`diagnosee`) or the instance that triggered the diagnosis (`diagnoser`). For example, if your tunnel is running in a Docker container, the diagnosee is the Docker instance and the diagnoser is the host instance.

[^1]: If the log file is blank, you may need to [set `--loglevel` to `debug`](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/logs/#view-logs-on-the-server) when you start the tunnel. The `--loglevel` parameter is only required if you ran the tunnel from the CLI using a `cloudflared tunnel run` command. It is not necessary if the tunnel runs as a Linux/macOS service or runs in Docker/Kubernetes.
