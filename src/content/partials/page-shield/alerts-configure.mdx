To configure an alert:

2. Choose **Add** and then select **Page Shield** in the **Product** dropdown.
3. Select an [alert type](/page-shield/alerts/alert-types/).
4. Enter the notification name and description.
5. (Optional) If you are an Enterprise customer with a paid add-on, you can [define the zones for which you want to filter alerts](/page-shield/alerts/#scoped-alerts) in **Policies of these zones**. This option requires that you define [allow policies](/page-shield/policies/#policy-actions) in the selected zones.
6. Select one or more notification destinations (notification email, webhooks, and connected notification services).
7. Select **Create**.

To edit, delete, or disable an alert, go to your [account notifications](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/notifications).
