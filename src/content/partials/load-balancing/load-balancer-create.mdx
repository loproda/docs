To create a Public or a Private load balancer in the dashboard:

### Create a Public load balancer

1. Go to **Load Balancing** and select **Create load balancer**.

2. On the **Load Balancer Setup**, select **Public load balancer** 

3. Choose the website to which you want to add this load balancer. 

4. On the **Hostname** page:
   * Enter a **Hostname**, which is the DNS name at which the load balancer is available. For more details on record priority, refer to [DNS records for load balancing](/load-balancing/load-balancers/dns-records/).
   * From the **Data Localization** dropdown, select the [region](/data-localization/how-to/load-balancing/#regional-services) you would like to use on your domain.
   * Toggle the orange cloud icon to update the [proxy mode](/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/), which affects how traffic is routed and which IP addresses are advertised.
   * Add a description for your load balancer. 
   * If you want [session-based load balancing](/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/), toggle the **Session Affinity** switch.
   * If you want [Adaptive Routing](/load-balancing/understand-basics/adaptive-routing/), toggle the **Adaptive Routing** switch.

5. Select **Next**.

6. On the **Add a Pool** page:
   * Select one or more existing pools or [create a new pool](/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/#create-a-pool).
   * If you are going to set [traffic steering](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/standard-options/) to **Off**, re-order the pools in your load balancer to adjust the fallback order.
   * If needed, update the [**Fallback Pool**](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/#fallback-pools).
   * If you choose to set traffic steering to **Random**, you can set [Weights](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/standard-options/#random-steering) (via the API) to your pools to determine the percentage of traffic sent to each pool.

7. Select **Next**.

8. On the **Monitors** page:
   * Review the monitors attached to your pools.
   * If needed, you can attach an existing monitor or [create a new monitor](/load-balancing/monitors/create-monitor/#create-a-monitor).

9. Select **Next**.

10. On the **Traffic Steering** page, choose an option for [Traffic steering](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/) and select **Next**.

11. On the **Custom Rules** page, select an existing rule or [create a new rule](/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/).
