Before your domain can begin using Cloudflare for DNS resolution, you need to [add these nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#update-your-nameservers) at your registrar. DNSSEC should still be **disabled** at this point.

If you cannot [change your domain nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/), you can still use Cloudflare on your website by activating Cloudflare through a [certified hosting partner](https://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners) using a [partial (CNAME) setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/).
