**Important Update:** Cloudflare now supports native User Groups for enhanced access control. This new feature replaces the previous method of directly assigning Cloudflare roles based on IdP group mappings (identified by the pattern `CF-<accountID> - <Role Name>`), which is deprecated as of June 2nd, 2025. SCIM Virtual Groups will reach end-of-life on December 2, 2025. Update your SCIM configurations using the instructions below to utilize User Groups for seamless provisioning.
