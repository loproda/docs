## Forward a client certificate

In addition to enforcing mTLS authentication for your host, you can also forward a client certificate to your origin server as an HTTP header. This setup is often helpful for server logging.

To avoid adding the certificate to every single request, the certificate is only forwarded on the first request of an mTLS connection.

:::caution
This process is only available on accounts with [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/).

### Cloudflare API

The most common approach to forwarding a certificate is to use the Cloudflare API to [update an mTLS certificate's hostname settings](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/access/subresources/certificates/subresources/settings/methods/update/).

<APIRequest
  path="/zones/{zone_id}/access/certificates/settings"
  method="PUT"
  json={{
		  "settings": [
    {
      "hostname": "<HOSTNAME>",
      "china_network": false,
      "client_certificate_forwarding": true
    }
  ]
	}}
	code={{
		mark: [10]
	}}
/>

Once `client_certificate_forwarding` is set to `true`, every request within an mTLS connection will now include the following headers:

* `Cf-Client-Cert-Der-Base64`
* `Cf-Client-Cert-Sha256`

### Managed Transforms

You can also [modify HTTP response headers](/rules/transform/response-header-modification/) using Managed Transforms to pass along **TLS client auth headers**.

### Cloudflare Workers

Additionally, Workers can provide details around the [client certificate](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/mtls/).

```js
const tlsHeaders = {
    'X-CERT-ISSUER-DN': request.cf.tlsClientAuth.certIssuerDN,
    'X-CERT-SUBJECT-DN': request.cf.tlsClientAuth.certSubjectDN,
    'X-CERT-ISSUER-DN-L': request.cf.tlsClientAuth.certIssuerDNLegacy,
    'X-CERT-SUBJECT-DN-L': request.cf.tlsClientAuth.certSubjectDNLegacy,
    'X-CERT-SERIAL': request.cf.tlsClientAuth.certSerial,
    'X-CERT-FINGER': request.cf.tlsClientAuth.certFingerprintSHA1,
    'X-CERT-VERIFY': request.cf.tlsClientAuth.certVerify,
    'X-CERT-NOTBE': request.cf.tlsClientAuth.certNotBefore,
    'X-CERT-NOTAF': request.cf.tlsClientAuth.certNotAfter
};
```
