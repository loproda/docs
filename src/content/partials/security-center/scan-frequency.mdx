Once you enable Security Insights, Cloudflare performs scans automatically. Paying customers (as defined in the table below) are re-scanned daily and can trigger a scan manually:

| Plan                                              | Scan Frequency   | On-Demand |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Accounts with a Pro, Business or Enterprise Zone  | Daily            | Yes       |
| Accounts with a Teams Standard or Enterprise plan | Daily            | Yes       |
