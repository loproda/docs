1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. In the Account Home, go to **Security Center** > **Security Insights**.
3. Under **Enable Security Center scans**, select **Start scan**.

The initial Security Insights scan will start. Security Insights will scan your Cloudflare environment and provide you with a list of detected [insights](/security-center/security-insights/). Refer to [How it works](/security-center/security-insights/how-it-works/) to learn more about how Security Insights perform a scan. 

The initial scan time depends on the number of IT assets in all the domains of your Cloudflare account. When the scan is complete, the status of the page will change from **Scan in Progress** to **Last scan performed on: `<DATE_TIME>`**.
