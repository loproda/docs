Webhook, PagerDuty, and email notifications are sent following an auto-advertisement attempt for all prefixes inside the flagged rule.

You will receive the status of the advertisement for each prefix with the following available statuses:

- **Advertised**: The prefix was successfully advertised.
- **Already Advertised**: The prefix was advertised prior to the auto advertisement attempt.
- **Delayed**: The prefix cannot currently be advertised but will attempt advertisement. After the prefix can be advertised, a new notification is sent with the updated status.
- **Locked**: The prefix is locked and cannot be advertised.
- **Could not Advertise**: Cloudflare was unable to advertise the prefix. This status can occur for multiple reasons, but usually occurs when you are not allowed to advertise a prefix.
- **Error**: A general error occurred during prefix advertisement.
