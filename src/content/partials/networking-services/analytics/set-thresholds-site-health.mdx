When you set up an alert for your site, you will be notified when there is an issue with one or more on-ramps. These alerts are sent when the percentage of successful health checks for a Magic WAN on-ramp drops below the selected service-level objective (SLO). Setting health alerts will also show unhealthy tunnels in the Network map and in the Traffic overview sections.

To set up health alerts:

1. Configure [Magic Tunnel health alerts](/magic-wan/configuration/common-settings/configure-magic-tunnel-health-alerts/) across all of the Magic Tunnels associated with each Magic WAN site.
2. After configuring Magic Tunnel health alerts, any Magic WAN site with a Magic Tunnel (on-ramp) that is outside of its SLO threshold will be labeled unhealthy in Network map and Traffic overview.
