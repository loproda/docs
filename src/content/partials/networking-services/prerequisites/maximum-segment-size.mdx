Before enabling {props.productName}, you must make sure that you set up the maximum segment size on your network. Cloudflare {props.productName} uses tunnels to deliver [packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) from our global network to your data centers. Cloudflare encapsulates these packets adding new headers. You must account for the space consumed by these headers when configuring the maximum transmission unit (MTU) and maximum segment size (MSS) values for your network.
