:::caution[Anycast routing]
Remember that Cloudflare uses anycast to route traffic. Anycast is a network addressing and routing method in which incoming requests can be routed to a variety of different locations. Because of this, traffic might land in a different geographic location than expected. Not all requests are sent to the closest data center due to the complex nature of Internet routing and peering relationships, and how Cloudflare optimizes for performance and reliability.
