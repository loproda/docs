This can take several minutes.</p>

		We recommend [routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/) all traffic through our global network for comprehensive security filtering and access controls. However, there may be specific cases where you want a subset of traffic to bypass Cloudflare's security filtering and route it directly to the Internet. You can scope this breakout traffic to specific applications from the Cloudflare dashboard.

    Refer to [Traffic steering](/magic-wan/reference/traffic-steering/) to learn how Cloudflare routes traffic.

## Add an application to your account

Before you can add or remove {props.featureName} applications to your Connector, you need to create an account-level list with the applications that you want to configure. Currently, adding to or modifying this list is only possible via API, through the [`managed_app_id`](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/apps/methods/create/) endpoint.

To add applications to your account:

Send a `POST` request to add new apps to your account.

	<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/magic/apps"
	method="POST"
	json={{
    "managed_app_id": "<APP_ID>",
    "name": "<APP_NAME>",
    "type": "<APP_TYPE>",
	}}
	/>

	```json output
	{
		"result": {
			"account_app_id": "eb09v665c0784618a3e4ba9809258fd4",
			"name": "<APP_NAME>",
			"type": "<APP_TYPE>",
		},
		"success": true,
		"errors": [],
		"messages": []
	}
	```

You can now add this new app to the {props.featureName} list in your Connector.

### Add an application to Connector

You need to configure {props.featureName} applications for each of your existing sites, as this is a per-site configuration.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select **Magic WAN** > **Connector on-ramps (beta)**.
3. Select the Connector you want to configure > **Edit**.
4. Select **Traffic Steering**.
5. In **{props.featureName}**, select **Add**.
6. Select one or more applications that should bypass Cloudflare filtering from the list. You can also use the search box.
7. Select **Add applications**.

The traffic for the application you chose {props.whatHappensApp}.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="account-id-api-key" product="networking-services" />

1. Send a `GET` [request](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/apps/methods/list/) to list the applications associated with an account.

	<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/magic/apps"
	method="GET"
	/>

	```json output
		{
			"result": [
				{
					"managed_app_id": "<APP_ID>",
					"name": "<APP_NAME>",
					"type": "File Sharing",
					"hostnames": [
						"<app_name.com>",
						"<app-name.info>"
					]
				}
			]
		}
	```

	Take note of the `"managed_app_id"` value for any application you want to add.

2. Send a `POST` request to add new apps to the {props.featureName} policy.

	<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/magic/sites/{site_id}/app_configs"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		"managed_app_id": "<MANAGED_APP_ID>",
		"breakout": true
	}}
	/>

	```json output
	{
		"result": {
			"account_app_id": "<APP_ID>",
			"name": "<APP_NAME>",
			"type": "<BREAKOUT_OR_PRIORITY>"
		},
		"success": true,
		"errors": [],
		"messages": []
	}
	```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### Delete an application from Connector

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select **Magic WAN** > **Connector on-ramps (beta)**.
3. Select the Connector you want to configure > **Edit**.
4. Select **Traffic Steering**.
5. In **{props.featureName}**, find the application you want to delete, and select the **three dots** next to it.
6. Select **Remove**.
7. (Optional) If you have several pages of applications, you can use the search box to quickly find the application you are looking for.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="account-id-api-key" product="networking-services" />

You need to delete {props.featureName} applications for each of your existing sites, as this is a per-site configuration.

1. Send a [`GET` request](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/apps/methods/list/) to list the applications associated with a site.

	<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/magic/sites/{site_id}/app_configs"
	method="GET"
	/>

	```json output
		{
			"result": [
				{
					"id": "<APP_ID>",
					"site_id": "<SITE_ID>",
					"managed_app_id": "<APP_NAME>",
					"breakout": true
				}
			]
		}
	```

	Take note of the `"id"` value for the application that want to delete.

2. Send a `DELETE` request to delete an application from the {props.featureName} policy.

	<CURL
	url="https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/sites/{site_id}/app_configs/{id}"
	method="DELETE"
	/>

	```json output
