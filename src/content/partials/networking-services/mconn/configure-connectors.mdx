		Before you can install Virtual Connector, you need an Enterprise account with Magic WAN enabled. Additionally, you need to have a VMware or Proxmox host with sufficient compute, memory, and storage to run the virtual machine with Virtual Connector. This includes:
    - Intel x86 CPU architecture
    - ESXi hypervisor 7.0U1 or higher
    - 4 virtual CPUs per virtual connector (We recommend deployment with a 1:1 virtual CPU to physical core allocation to avoid CPU over contention which will cause packet loss.)
    - 8 GB of RAM per virtual connector
    - 8 GB of disk per virtual connector
    - One vSwitch port group or VLAN with access to the Internet (for example, through a WAN)
    - One or more vSwitch port group or VLAN that will be the internal LAN

## Before you begin

There are a couple of decisions you need to make when installing your {props.productName}. Refer to the topics below for more information.

### Determine the need for a high availability configuration

You can install up to two {props.productName}s for redundancy at each of your sites. If one of your Connectors fails, traffic will fail over to the other Connector ensuring that you never lose connectivity to that site.

In this type of high availability (HA) configuration, you will choose a reliable LAN interface as the HA link which will be used to monitor the health of the peer connector. HA links can be dedicated links or can be shared with other LAN traffic.

You must decide the type of configuration you want for your site from the beginning: no redundancy or with redundancy. You cannot add redundancy after finishing the configuration of your dashboard settings. If, at a later stage, you decide to enable redundancy, you will need to delete your Connector on-ramp in the Cloudflare dashboard, and start again.

<Card title="Do you need a high availability configuration?" icon="information">

- If you need a high availability configuration for your premises, refer to
  [About high availability configurations](#about-high-availability-configurations) for more information
  and learn how to configure your Connector in this mode.

- If you do not need a high availability configuration for you premises, check if you need a [DHCP or a static IP setup](#decide-on-dhcp-vs-static-ip-connections) before proceeding to [Set up Cloudflare dashboard](#set-up-cloudflare-dashboard).

</Card>

:::caution
You cannot enable high availability for an existing Connector on-ramp. To add high availability to an existing Connector on-ramp in the Cloudflare dashboard, you need to delete the on-ramp and start again. Plan accordingly to create a high availability configuration from the start if needed.
:::


### Decide on DHCP vs static IP connections

{ props.magicWord === "hardware" && (
  <>
    <p>You can use Magic WAN Connector in both DHCP networks and networks that require a static IP configuration. At first boot, however, Magic WAN Connector needs to reach out to Cloudflare to download your settings and go through the activation process. If any of the networks plugged into your Connector are DHCP enabled, does not use a VLAN, and have an Internet connection, that process is handled automatically. However, if all of the networks require more information to utilize, (such as a network with static IPs, or tagged VLAN networks) your Magic WAN Connector might need some more information to proceed.</p>

		<p>There are couple of ways to provide this information. Choose the one that fits your workflow: </p>

		<AnchorHeading title="Option one - Activate on a DHCP Network" depth={4} />

		<Markdown

### Add a Connector on-ramp

You need to add your Connector to your Cloudflare dashboard and configure its settings before connecting it to the Internet.

To add a Connector on-ramp:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **Magic WAN** > **Connector on-ramps (beta)**.
3. Select **Add**.
4. In **Name**, enter a descriptive name for your Connector. Optionally, you can also add a description for it.
5. You need to decide if you want to turn on high availability for the Connector. Refer to [About high availability configurations](#about-high-availability-configurations) for more information.
6. Select **Create and continue**.
7. Select **Add Connector**. This will show you a list of Magic WAN Connector devices associated with your account. <Markdown text={props.noConnectorShows} />
8. If you have more than one Connector, choose the one that corresponds to the on-ramp you are creating. Connectors are identified by a serial number, also known as a service tag. Use this information to choose the right Connector. Select **Select Connector** when you are ready to proceed.
9. The Connector will be added to your account with an **Interrupt window** defined. The interrupt window is the time period when the Magic WAN Connector software can update, which may result in interruption to existing connections. You can change this later. Refer to [Interrupt window](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/maintenance/interrupt-service-window/) for more details on how to define when the Connector can update its systems.
10. Select **Continue** to proceed to creating your WAN and LAN networks.

### Create a WAN

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In **WAN configuration**, select **Create**. You can create one or more [wide area networks (WANs)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-wan/). Configuring multiple WANs will create multiple <GlossaryTooltip term="IPsec tunnel">IPsec</GlossaryTooltip> tunnels (one IPsec tunnel per WAN port). This allows the Connector to load balance traffic over WANs of equal priority. It also allows Connector to failover between circuits according to their <GlossaryTooltip term="tunnel health-check" link="/magic-wan/reference/tunnel-health-checks/">health</GlossaryTooltip>. Refer to [WAN settings](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/reference/#wan-settings) for more details.
		:::note
		This is not the same as a high availability (HA) configuration. HA configurations need two Connectors to work. Refer to [About high availability configurations](#about-high-availability-configurations) for more information.
		:::
2. In **Interface name**, enter a descriptive name for your WAN.
3. **Interface number** <Markdown text={props.wan} />
4. In **VLAN ID**, enter a number between `0` and `4094` to specify a [VLAN ID](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/reference/#vlan-id).
5. In **Priority**, choose the priority for your WAN. Lower numbers have higher priority. Refer to <GlossaryTooltip term="traffic steering" link="/magic-wan/reference/traffic-steering/">Traffic steering</GlossaryTooltip> to learn more about how Cloudflare calculates priorities.
6. In **Health check rate** configure the health check frequency for your site. Options are `low`, `mid`, and `high`. Refer to [Update tunnel health checks frequency](/magic-wan/configuration/common-settings/update-tunnel-health-checks-frequency/) for more information.
7. **Addressing**: Select **DHCP**. This is needed the first time you set up your Connector to successfully download all settings to the machine and activate it. If you need a static IP address in your network environment:
	1. Continue the set up flow below to activate your Connector.
	2. Refer to [WAN with a static IP address](#wan-with-a-static-ip-address). If you choose a static IP, you also need to specify the static IP and gateway addresses.
8. Select **Save** when you are finished.

#### Network segmentation

After setting up your LANs, you can configure your Connector to enable communication between them without traffic leaving your premises. Refer to [Network segmentation](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/network-options/network-segmentation/) for more information.

#### DHCP options

Magic WAN Connector supports different types of DHCP configurations. Connector can:

- Connect to a DHCP server or use a static IP address instead of connecting to a DHCP server.
- Act as a [DHCP server](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/network-options/dhcp/dhcp-server/).
- Use [DHCP relay](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/network-options/dhcp/dhcp-relay/) to connect to a DHCP server outside the location your Magic WAN Connector is in.
- [Reserve IP addresses](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/network-options/dhcp/dhcp-static-address-reservation/) for specific devices on your network.

Refer to [DHCP options](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/network-options/dhcp/) to learn more.

## About high availability configurations

{props.hardSoftConn} When you set up a site in high availability, the WANs and LANs in your Connectors have the same configuration but are replicated on two nodes. In case of failure of a Connector, the other Connector becomes the active node, taking over configuration of the LAN gateway IP and allowing traffic to continue without disruption.

Because Connectors in high availability configurations share a single site, you need to set up:

- **Static address**: The IP for the primary node in your site.
- **Secondary static address**: The IP for the secondary node in your site.
- **Virtual static address**: The IP that the LAN south of the Connector will forward traffic to, which is the LAN's gateway IP.

Make sure all IPs are part of the same subnet.

For detailed information about the expected behavior of high availability configurations, refer to [High availability configurations](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/reference/#high-availability-configurations).

### Create a high availability configuration

You cannot enable high availability for an existing site. To add high availability to an existing site in the Cloudflare dashboard, you need to delete the site and start again.

To set up a high availability configuration:

1. Follow the steps in [Add a Connector on-ramp](#add-a-connector-on-ramp) up until step 4.
2. After naming your site, select **Turn on high availability**.
3. Select **Create and continue**.
4. Select **Add Connector**.
5. From the list, choose your first Connector > **Add Connector**.
6. Back on the previous screen, select **Add secondary Connector**.
7. From the list, choose your second Connector > **Add Connector**.
8. Select **Continue** to [Create a WAN](#create-a-wan). If you are configuring a static IP, configure the IP for the primary node as the static address, and the IP for the secondary node as the secondary static address.
9. To create a LAN, follow the steps mentioned above in [Create a LAN](#create-a-lan) up until step 4.
10. In **Static address**, enter the IP for the primary node in your site. For example, `192.168.10.1/24`.
11. In **Secondary static address**, enter the IP for the secondary node in your site. For example, `192.168.10.2/24`.
12. In **Virtual static address**, enter the IP that the LAN south of the Connector will forward traffic to. For example, `192.168.10.3/24`.
13. Select **Save**.
14. From the **High availability probing link** drop-down menu, select the port that should be used to monitor the node's health. Cloudflare recommends you choose a reliable interface as the HA probing link. The primary and secondary node's probing link should be connected over a switch, and cannot be a direct connection.

## IPsec tunnels and static routes

Magic WAN Connector automatically creates [IPsec tunnels](/magic-wan/reference/gre-ipsec-tunnels/#ipsec-tunnels) and [static routes](/magic-wan/reference/traffic-steering/) for you. You cannot configure these manually.

To check the IPsec tunnels and static routes created by your Magic WAN Connector:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **Magic WAN** > **Sites**.
3. Select the name of the site for which you want to check the Connector's IPsec tunnels and static routes, and select **Edit**.
4. Select **Tunnels** to check IPsec tunnels, and **Routes** for the static routes.
