:::note[VLAN tagging]
Virtual Connector supports creating subinterfaces through the use of [802.1Q VLAN tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q).

Use VLAN ID <code>0</code> when:

- Connected to a Port Group or Distributed Port Group that is associated with a specific VLAN.
- Connected to a Port Group or Distributed Port Group that is configured as a trunk that requires untagged packets.

You can also configure subinterfaces on the Virtual Connector by associating the network interface with a Port Group or Distributed Port Group trunk and specifying a VLAN ID in addition to the port associated with the network interface (VLAN ID <code>1</code>-<code>4094</code>).
