If your main domain is using Cloudflare's [Universal SSL certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/), that certificate also covers all first-level subdomains (`blog.example.com`).

For deeper subdomains (`dev.blog.example.com`), use a [different type of certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/limitations/#full-setup).

:::note[Proxy status]
Cloudflare can only serve an SSL/TLS certificate for a DNS record when you set the record's [proxy status](/dns/proxy-status/) to **Proxied**. If you do not do this, the origin server your record points to will be responsible for supporting SSL/TLS connections.
