During an [internal DNS query resolution](/dns/internal-dns/#architecture-overview), if no internal record is found within a matching internal zone, Cloudflare will check if the matching internal zone is referencing another internal zone. Successive references can be followed with a maximum of five references in a chain.

:::note
A wildcard record in the matching internal zone will take precedence over an exact match in a referenced zone.
:::

Each internal zone can only reference one other zone, but the same zone can be referenced by multiple internal zones. Public zones cannot be used as reference zones.
