## Threat score

Previously, a threat score represented a Cloudflare threat score from 0â€“100, where 0 indicates low risk. Now, the threat score is always `0` (zero).

:::note[Recommendation]
Currently we do not recommend creating rules based on the threat score, since this score is no longer being populated.
