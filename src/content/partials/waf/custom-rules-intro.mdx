Custom rules allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests to a zone. They work as customized web application firewall (WAF) rules that you can use to perform actions like _Block_ or _Managed Challenge_ on incoming requests.

In the [new security dashboard](/security/), custom rules are one of the available types of [security rules](/security/rules/). Security rules perform security-related actions on incoming requests that match specified filters.

Like other rules evaluated by Cloudflare's [Ruleset Engine](/ruleset-engine/), custom rules have the following basic parameters:

- An [expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) that specifies the criteria you are matching traffic on using the [Rules language](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/).
- An [action](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/) that specifies what to perform when there is a match for the rule.
