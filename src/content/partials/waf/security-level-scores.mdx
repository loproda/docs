In the old Cloudflare dashboard, security level has the value _Always protected_ and you cannot change this setting. To turn [Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/) on or off, use the separate toggle.

In the new security dashboard, the Cloudflare API, and in Terraform, use security level to turn Under Attack mode on or off.

Cloudflare's [Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/) performs additional security checks to help mitigate layer 7 DDoS attacks. When you enable Under Attack mode, Cloudflare will present a JS challenge page.

:::caution

Only use [Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/) when a website is under a DDoS attack. Under Attack mode may affect some actions on your domain, such as your API traffic.

To enable or disable Under Attack mode for your API or any other part of your domain, create a [configuration rule](/rules/configuration-rules/).
