### Next steps

To configure the {props.rulesetName} via API, create [overrides](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) using the Rulesets API. You can perform the following configurations:

<ul>
	{props.customizableAction && (
		<li>
			Specify the action to perform for all the rules in the ruleset by creating
			a ruleset override.
		</li>
	)}
	<li>
		Disable {props.customizableAction && "or customize the action of"}
		individual rules by creating rule overrides.
	</li>
</ul>

For examples of creating overrides using the API, refer to [Override a managed ruleset](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/).
