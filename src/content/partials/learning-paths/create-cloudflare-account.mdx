To create a new Cloudflare account:

1. [Sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) on the Cloudflare dashboard.

2. To secure your account, enable [two-factor authentication](/fundamentals/user-profiles/2fa/).

3. If you have a Cloudflare contact (Enterprise only), ask them to set up your account as a multi-user organization. Account members will need:
   - [**Access** permissions](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/) to read or edit applications and Access policies.
   - [**Gateway** permissions](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/) to read or edit Gateway policies.
   - [**PII** permissions](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/#cloudflare-zero-trust-pii) to view user information in Gateway activity logs.
