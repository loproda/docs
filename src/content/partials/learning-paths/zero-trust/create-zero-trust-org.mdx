To start using Zero Trust features, create a Zero Trust organization in your Cloudflare account.

## Sign up for Zero Trust

To create a Zero Trust organization:

<Render file="choose-team-name" product="cloudflare-one" />

## (Optional) Manage Zero Trust in Terraform

You can use the [Cloudflare Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest) to manage your Zero Trust organization alongside your other IT infrastructure. To get started with Terraform, refer to our [Terraform tutorial series](/terraform/tutorial/).

To add Zero Trust to your Terraform configuration:

1. [Sign up for Zero Trust](#sign-up-for-zero-trust) on the Cloudflare dashboard.

2. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Access: Organizations, Identity Providers, and Groups Write`

3. Add the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_organization`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_organization) resource:

	```terraform
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_organization" "<your-team-name>" {
		account_id                         = var.cloudflare_account_id
		name                               = "Acme Corporation"
		auth_domain                        = "<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com"
	}
	```
	Replace `<your-team-name` with the Zero Trust organization name selected during [onboarding](#sign-up-for-zero-trust). You can also view your team name on [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) under **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.

You can now update Zero Trust organization settings using Terraform.

:::tip
If you plan to manage all Zero Trust settings in Terraform, set the dashboard to [API/Terraform read-only mode](/cloudflare-one/api-terraform/#set-dashboard-to-read-only).
