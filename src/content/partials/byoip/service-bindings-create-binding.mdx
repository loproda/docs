:::caution[Caution]
Once a service binding is created (or deleted), it will take **four to six hours** to propagate across Cloudflare's global network. Services for the IP addresses in scope will likely be disrupted during this window.
:::

1. Make a `POST` request to the [Create service binding](/api/resources/addressing/subresources/prefixes/subresources/service_bindings/methods/create/) endpoint, indicating the IP address you want to bind to {props.added_product}. Specify the **corresponding network mask** as needed.

<Example>

Continuing the example, `203.0.113.100/32` designates an IP address that is within the {props.pre_existing_product} prefix `203.0.113.0/24`.

Replace the `{prefix_id}` in the URI with your prefix ID from previous steps. Within the request body, the `cidr` value should correspond to the IP address or subnet that you are configuring for use with {props.added_product}.

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/addressing/prefixes/{prefix_id}/bindings"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		  "cidr": "203.0.113.100/32",
			"service_id": "<SERVICE_ID>"
	}}
  code={{
    mark: [6, 7]
  }}
/>

In the response body, the initial provisioning state should be `provisioning`.

```json output {9}
{
  "errors": [],
  "messages": [],
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "cidr": "203.0.113.100/32",
    "id": "<SERVICE_BINDING_ID>",
    "provisioning": {
      "state": "provisioning"
      },
    "service_id": "<SERVICE_ID>",
    "service_name": "<SERVICE_NAME>"
  }
}
```

</Example>

You can periodically check the service binding status using the [List Service Bindings](/api/resources/addressing/subresources/prefixes/subresources/service_bindings/methods/list/) endpoint.
