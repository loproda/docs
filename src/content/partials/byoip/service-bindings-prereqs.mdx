Cloudflare **strongly** recommends implementing service bindings through an **aggregated** CIDR block, as it is more efficient than adding discrete bindings for non-contiguous CIDR blocks.

<Details header="Example">

**{props.pre_existing_product} protected prefix:** `203.0.113.0/24`

**IPs to upgrade to {props.added_product}:**

`203.0.113.16`<br />
`203.0.113.17`<br />
`203.0.113.18`<br />
`203.0.113.19`<br />
`203.0.113.20`<br />
`203.0.113.21`<br />
`203.0.113.22`<br />
`203.0.113.23`

Add one discrete {props.added_product} service binding for `203.0.113.16` with a `/29` netmask.

</Details>

Once a service binding is created (or deleted), it will take **four to six hours** to propagate across Cloudflare's global network. Services for the IP addresses in scope will likely be disrupted during this window.

:::note
This guide assumes that the prefix is tied to a single Cloudflare account that has both {props.pre_existing_product} and {props.added_product} properties. If you are using [prefix delegations](/byoip/concepts/prefix-delegations/), the service bindings must be [created](#2-create-service-binding) on the parent account.
