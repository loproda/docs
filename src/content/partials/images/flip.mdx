import { Tabs, TabItem } from "~/components"

Flips the image horizontally, vertically, or both. Can be used with the `rotate` parameter to set the orientation of an image.

Flipping is performed before rotation. For example, if you apply `flip=h,rotate=90,` then the image will be flipped horizontally, then rotated by 90 degrees.

Available options are:

- `h`: Flips the image horizontally.
- `v`: Flips the image vertically.
- `hv`: Flips the image vertically and horizontally.

    ```js
    flip=h
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Workers">
  ```js
  cf: {image: {flip: "h"}}
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
