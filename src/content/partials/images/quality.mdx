import { Tabs, TabItem } from "~/components";

Specifies quality for images in JPEG, WebP, and AVIF formats. The quality is in a 1-100 scale, but useful values are between `50` (low quality, small file size) and `90` (high quality, large file size). `85` is the default. When using the PNG format, an explicit quality setting allows use of PNG8 (palette) variant of the format. Use the `format=auto` option to allow use of WebP and AVIF formats.

We also allow setting one of the perceptual quality levels `high|medium-high|medium-low|low`
