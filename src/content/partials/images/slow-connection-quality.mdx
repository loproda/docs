import { Tabs, TabItem } from "~/components";

Allows overriding `quality` value whenever a slow connection is detected.

Available options are same as [quality](/images/transform-images/transform-via-url/#quality).

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="URL format">
		```js
		slow-connection-quality=50
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="URL format alias">
		```js
		scq=50
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Detecting slow connections is currently only supported on Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Opera.

You can enable any of the following client hints via HTTP in a header

```txt
accept-ch: rtt, save-data, ect, downlink
```

slow-connection-quality applies whenever any of the following is true and the client hint is present:

- [rtt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/RTT): Greater than 150ms.

- [save-data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Save-Data): Value is "on".

- [ect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ECT): Value is one of `slow-2g|2g|3g`.

- [downlink](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Downlink): Less than 5Mbps.
