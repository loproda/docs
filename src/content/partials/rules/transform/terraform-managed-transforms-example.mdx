Use the `cloudflare_managed_headers` Terraform resource to configure Managed Transforms. For example:

```tf
resource "cloudflare_managed_headers" "tf_example" {
  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"

  managed_request_headers {
    id      = "add_visitor_location_headers"
    enabled = true
  }

  managed_response_headers {
    id      = "remove_x-powered-by_header"
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

Make sure you include the Managed Transforms you are updating in the correct object (`managed_request_headers` or `managed_response_headers`).
