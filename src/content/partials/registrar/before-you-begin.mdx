## Before transferring a domain to Cloudflare

* Create [a Cloudflare account](/fundamentals/account/create-account/).
* [Add the domain](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/) you are transferring to your Cloudflare account.
* [Review your DNS records](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#review-dns-records) in the Cloudflare dashboard.
* If needed, plan for [DNSSEC disablement](#disable-dnssec).
* [Change your DNS nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) to Cloudflare.
* If initiating multiple transfers, notify your financial institution to prevent them from flagging these charges as fraudulent.
* Renew your domain if it is within 15 days of expiration.
* Do not make any changes to the Registrant contact information. Updating the Registrant contact may result in your current registrar locking the domain for 60 days.
* Make sure your account has a valid credit card on file.
* If you are transferring a `.us` domain, refer to the [Additional requirements for .US domains](/registrar/top-level-domains/us-domains/) before proceeding.

### Disable DNSSEC

If you are onboarding an existing domain to Cloudflare, make sure DNSSEC **is disabled** at your registrar. Otherwise, your domain will experience connectivity errors when you change your nameservers.

1. Take note of the <GlossaryTooltip term="time-to-live (TTL)">TTL</GlossaryTooltip> value for the DS record at your current registrar.
2. Remove DS records at your current registrar.

3. Wait at least the time corresponding to the DS record TTL. It is usually 24 hours, but refer to the value you got in step 1.
4. Follow the steps to [transfer your domain](/registrar/get-started/transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/#set-up-a-domain-transfer) to Cloudflare Registrar.
5. [Enable DNSSEC](/dns/dnssec/#1-activate-dnssec-in-cloudflare) at Cloudflare. This will automatically add your DS to the zone parent via Cloudflare Registrar.
