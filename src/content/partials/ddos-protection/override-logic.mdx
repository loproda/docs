When Cloudflare's DDoS Protection systems detect an attack, an ephemeral mitigation rule is created and installed in-line to mitigate the attack. A mitigation rule is generated based on the logic of the DDoS Protection managed ruleset. Each mitigation rule is generated from a single managed rule.

All mitigations and its associated managed rules are evaluated in order by the DDoS systems one by one. Cloudflare will go through all of the rule overrides defined in the ruleset overrides until one matches the managed rule, and apply the action and stop at that point. Otherwise, the evaluation will continue in order until a rule matches. 

You can create only one ruleset override that can contain one or multiple rule overrides. 

:::note
Enterprise customers with the [Advanced DDoS Protection](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/) add-on can create up to 10 ruleset overrides.

A rule override instructs the DDoS system on the action it should take against the attack according to its matching managed rule.

However, within a rule override, specificity matters and the DDoS system will choose the more specific configuration. A rule override takes precedence over the ruleset override.
