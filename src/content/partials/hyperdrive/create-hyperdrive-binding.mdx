You must create a binding in your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for your Worker to connect to your Hyperdrive configuration. [Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to access resources, like Hyperdrive, on the Cloudflare developer platform.

To bind your Hyperdrive configuration to your Worker, add the following to the end of your Wrangler file:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>" # the ID associated with the Hyperdrive you just created
```

</WranglerConfig>

Specifically:

- The value (string) you set for the `binding` (binding name) will be used to reference this database in your Worker. In this tutorial, name your binding `HYPERDRIVE`.
- The binding must be [a valid JavaScript variable name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variables). For example, `binding = "hyperdrive"` or `binding = "productionDB"` would both be valid names for the binding.
- Your binding is available in your Worker at `env.<BINDING_NAME>`.


If you wish to use a local database during development, you can add a `localConnectionString` to your  Hyperdrive configuration with the connection string of your database:


<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>" # the ID associated with the Hyperdrive you just created
localConnectionString = "<LOCAL_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URI>"
```

</WranglerConfig>
