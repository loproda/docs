## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing PlanetScale database by creating a new user and fetching your database connection string.

### Planetscale Dashboard

1. Go to the [**PlanetScale dashboard**](https://app.planetscale.com/) and select the database you wish to connect to.
2. Click **Connect**. Enter `hyperdrive-user` as the password name (or your preferred name) and configure the permissions as desired. Select **Create password**. Note the username and password as they will not be displayed again.
3. Select **Other** as your language or framework. Note down the database host, database name, database username, and password. You will need these to create a database configuration in Hyperdrive.

With the host, database name, username and password, you can now create a Hyperdrive database configuration.

:::note

When connecting to a Planetscale database with Hyperdrive, you should use a driver like [node-postgres (pg)](/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/node-postgres/) or [Postgres.js](/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/postgres-js/) to connect directly to the underlying database instead of the [Planetscale serverless driver](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver). Hyperdrive is optimized for database access for Workers and will perform global connection pooling and fast query routing by connecting directly to your database.
