We recommend that all Cloudflare user account holders enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to keep your accounts secure. 

2FA can only be enabled successfully on an account with a [verified email address](/fundamentals/user-profiles/verify-email-address/). If you do not verify your email address first, you may lock yourself out of your account.

:::caution

Super Administrators can turn on **2FA Enforcement** to require all members to enable 2FA. If you are not a Super Administrator, you will be forced to turn on 2FA prior to accepting the invitation to join a Cloudflare account as a member.
:::

To enable two-factor authentication for your Cloudflare login:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Under the **My Profile** dropdown, select **My Profile**.
3. Select **Authentication**. 
4. Select **Manage** in the Two-Factor Authentication card.
5. Configure either a [TOTP mobile app](/fundamentals/user-profiles/2fa/#configure-totp-mobile-application-authentication) or a [security key to enable 2FA on your account](/fundamentals/user-profiles/2fa/#configure-security-key-authentication-for-two-factor-cloudflare-login).
