    title: Deleted files now removed from index on next sync
    description: |-
      When a file is deleted from your R2 bucket, its corresponding chunks are now automatically removed from the Vectorize index linked to your AutoRAG instance during the next sync.

    title: Reduced cooldown between syncs
    description: |-
      The cooldown period between sync jobs has been reduced to **3 minutes**, allowing you to trigger syncs more frequently when updating your data. If a sync is requested during the cooldown window, the dashboard and API now return clear response indicating that the sync cannot proceed due to the cooldown.

    title: Rich format file size limit increased to 4 MB
    description: |-
      You can now index rich format files (e.g., PDF) up to 4 MB in size, up from the previous 1 MB limit.

    title: Index processing status displayed on dashboard

      The dashboard now includes a new “Processing” step for the indexing pipeline that displays the files currently being processed.

    title: Sync AutoRAG REST API published
    description: |-
      You can now trigger a sync job for an AutoRAG using the [Sync REST API](/api/resources/autorag/subresources/rags/methods/sync/). This scans your data source for changes and queues updated or previously errored files for indexing.

    title: Files modified in the data source will now be updated
    description: |-
      Files modified in your source R2 bucket will now be updated in the AutoRAG index during the next sync. For example, if you upload a new version of an existing file, the changes will be reflected in the index after the subsequent sync job.
      Please note that deleted files are not yet removed from the index. We are actively working on this functionality.

    title: Errored files will now be retried in next sync
    description: |-
      Files that failed to index will now be automatically retried in the next indexing job. For instance, if a file initially failed because it was oversized but was then corrected (e.g. replaced with a file of the same name/key within the size limit), it will be re-attempted during the next scheduled sync.

    title: Fixed character cutoff in recursive chunking
    description: |-
      Resolved an issue where certain characters (e.g. '#') were being cut off during the recursive chunking and embedding process. This fix ensures complete character processing in the indexing process.

    title: EU jurisdiction R2 buckets now supported
    description: |-
      AutoRAG now supports R2 buckets configured with European Union (EU) jurisdiction restrictions. Previously, files in EU-restricted R2 buckets would not index when linked. This issue has been resolved, and all EU-restricted R2 buckets should now function as expected.

    title: Response streaming in AutoRAG binding added
    description: |-
      AutoRAG now supports response streaming in the `AI Search` method of the [Workers binding](/autorag/usage/workers-binding/), allowing you to stream results as they’re retrieved by setting `stream: true`.
