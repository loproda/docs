releaseNotes: |-
  **Changes and improvements**
  - Fixed an issue where managed network policies could incorrectly report network location beacons as missing.
  - Improved DEX test error reporting.
  - Fixed an issue causing client notifications to fail in IPv6 only environments which prevented the client from receiving configuration changes to settings like device profile.
  - Improved captive portal detection.
  - Added a TCP fallback for the MASQUE tunnel protocol to improve compatibility with networks on MASQUE.
  - Added new IP addresses for [tunnel connectivity checks](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/#connectivity-checks). If your organization uses a firewall or other policies you will need to exempt these IPs.
  - DNS over HTTPS traffic is now included in the WARP tunnel by default.
  - Improved the error message displayed in the client GUI when the rate limit for entering an incorrect admin override code is met.
  - Added a [Collect Captive Portal Diag](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/captive-portals/#get-captive-portal-logs) button in the client GUI to make it easier for users to collect captive portal debugging diagnostics.
  - Improved handling of non-SLAAC IPv6 interface addresses for better connectivity in IPv6 only environments.
  - Fixed an issue where frequent network changes could cause WARP to become unresponsive.

  **Known issues**
  - macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.4 or later.
