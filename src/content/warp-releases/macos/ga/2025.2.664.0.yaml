  This release contains a hotfix for captive portal detection and PF state tables for the
  2025.2.600.0 release.


  **Changes and improvements**

  - Fix to reduce the number of browser tabs opened during captive portal logins.

  - Improvement to exclude local DNS traffic entries from PF state table to
  reduce risk of connectivity issues from exceeding table capacity.

  client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.4
  or later.
