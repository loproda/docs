releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains a hotfix for [managed networks](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/managed-networks/) for the 2025.4.929.0
  release.


  **Changes and improvements**

  - Fixed an issue where it could take up to 3 minutes for the correct device profile
  to be applied in some circumstances. In the worst case, it should now only
  take up to 40 seconds. This will be improved further in a future release.



  **Known issues**

  - macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP
  client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.4
  or later.
