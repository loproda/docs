releaseNotes: |-
  **Changes and improvements**
  - Fixed an issue causing reconnection loops when captive portals are detected.
  - Fixed an issue that caused WARP client disk encryption posture checks to fail due to missing drive names.
  - Fixed an issue where managed network policies could incorrectly report network location beacons as missing.
  - Improved error reporting for DEX tests.
  - Improved WARP client UI high contrast mode.
  - Fixed an issue causing client notifications to fail in IPv6 only environments which prevented the client from receiving configuration changes to settings like device profile.
  - Added a TCP fallback for the MASQUE tunnel protocol to improve compatibility with networks on MASQUE.
  - Added new IP addresses for [tunnel connectivity checks](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/#connectivity-checks). If your organization uses a firewall or other policies you will need to exempt these IPs.
  - DNS over HTTPS traffic is now included in the WARP tunnel by default.
  - Improved the error message displayed in the client GUI when the rate limit for entering an incorrect admin override code is met.
  - Added a [Collect Captive Portal Diag](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/captive-portals/#get-captive-portal-logs) button in the client GUI to make it easier for users to collect captive portal debugging diagnostics.
  - Improved handling of non-SLAAC IPv6 interface addresses for better connectivity in IPv6 only environments.
  - Fixed an issue where frequent network changes could cause WARP to become unresponsive.

  **Known issues**
  - DNS resolution may be broken when the following conditions are all true:
    - WARP is in Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering (tunnel-only) mode.
    - A custom DNS server address is configured on the primary network adapter.
    - The custom DNS server address on the primary network adapter is changed while WARP is connected.

    To work around this issue, reconnect the WARP client by toggling off and back on.
