releaseNotes: >-
  This release contains support for a new WARP setting, [Global WARP override](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#global-warp-override). It also includes significant improvements to our captive portal / public Wi-Fi detection logic. If you have experienced captive portal issues in the past, re-test and give this version a try.


  **Changes and improvements**

  - Improved [captive portal detection](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/captive-portals/) to make more public networks compatible and have faster detection.

  - Improved error messages shown in the app.

  - Added the ability to control if the WARP interface IPs are [registered with DNS servers](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#warp-interface-ip-dns-registration) or not.

  - Removed DNS logs view from the Windows client GUI. DNS logs can be viewed as part of `warp-diag` or by viewing the log file on the user's local directory.

  - Fixed an issue that would result in a user receiving multiple re-authentication requests when waking their device from sleep.

  - WARP tunnel protocol details can now be viewed using the `warp-cli tunnel stats` command.

  - Improvements to [Windows multi-user](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/windows-multiuser/) including support for fast user switching. If you are interested in testing this feature, reach out to your Cloudflare account team.

  - Fixed an issue with device revocation and re-registration when switching configurations.

  - Fixed an issue where DEX tests would run during certain sleep states where the networking stack was not fully up. This would result in failures that would be ignored.

  - Added a new [Global WARP override](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#global-warp-override) setting. This setting puts account administrators in control of disabling and enabling WARP across all devices registered to an account from the dashboard. Global WARP override is disabled by default.


  **Known issues**

  - DNS resolution may be broken when the following conditions are all true:
    - WARP is in Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering (tunnel-only) mode.
    - A custom DNS server address is configured on the primary network adapter.
    - The custom DNS server address on the primary network adapter is changed while WARP is connected.

    To work around this issue, reconnect the WARP client by toggling off and back on.
