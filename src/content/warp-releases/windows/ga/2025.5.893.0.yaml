releaseNotes: |-
  This release contains improvements and new exciting features, including [SCCM VPN boundary support](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#sccm-vpn-boundary-support) and [post-quantum cryptography](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/#enable_post_quantum). By tunneling your corporate network traffic over Cloudflare, you can now gain the immediate protection of post-quantum cryptography without needing to upgrade any of your individual corporate applications or systems.

  **Changes and improvements**
  - Fixed a device registration issue that caused WARP connection failures when changing networks.
  - Captive portal improvements and fixes:
     - Captive portal sign in notifications will now be sent through operating system notification services.
     - Fix for firewall configuration issue affecting clients in DoH only mode.
  - Improved the connectivity status message in the client GUI.
  - Fixed a bug affecting clients in Gateway with DoH mode where the original DNS servers were not restored after disabling WARP.
  - The WARP client now applies post-quantum cryptography end-to-end on enabled devices accessing resources behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. This feature can be [enabled by MDM](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/#enable_post_quantum).
  - Improvement to handle client configuration changes made by an MDM while WARP is not running.
  - Improvements for multi-user experience to better handle fast user switching and transitions from a pre-login to a logged-in state.
  - Added a WARP client device posture check for SAN attributes to the [client certificate check](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/client-certificate/).
  - Fixed an issue affecting Split Tunnel Include mode, where traffic outside the tunnel was blocked when switching between Wi-Fi and Ethernet networks.
  - Added [SCCM VPN boundary support](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#sccm-vpn-boundary-support) to device profile settings. With SCCM VPN boundary support enabled, operating systems will register WARP's local interface IP with the on-premise DNS server when reachable.
  - Fix for an issue causing WARP connectivity to fail without full system reboot.

  **Known issues**
  - For Windows 11 24H2 users, Microsoft has confirmed a regression that may lead to performance issues like mouse lag, audio cracking, or other slowdowns. Cloudflare recommends users experiencing these issues upgrade to a minimum [Windows 11 24H2 version KB5060829](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-8-2025-kb5062553-os-build-26100-4652-523e69cb-051b-43c6-8376-6a76d6caeefd) or higher for resolution.
  - Devices with `KB5055523` installed may receive a warning about `Win32/ClickFix.ABA` being present in the installer. To resolve this false positive, update Microsoft Security Intelligence to [version 1.429.19.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions/antimalware-definition-release-notes?requestVersion=1.429.19.0) or later.
  - DNS resolution may be broken when the following conditions are all true:
    - WARP is in Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering (tunnel-only) mode.
    - A custom DNS server address is configured on the primary network adapter.
    - The custom DNS server address on the primary network adapter is changed while WARP is connected.

    To work around this issue, reconnect the WARP client by toggling off and back on.
