  This release contains a hotfix for captive portal detection for the 2025.2.600.0
  release.


  **Changes and improvements**

  - Fix to reduce the number of browser tabs opened during captive portal logins.


  **Known issues**

  - DNS resolution may be broken when the following conditions are all true:
    - WARP is in Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering (tunnel-only) mode.
    - A custom DNS server address is configured on the primary network adapter.
