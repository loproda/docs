  **Changes and improvements**

  This release contains improvements and new exciting features, including
  post-quantum cryptography. By tunnelling your corporate network traffic over
  Cloudflare, you can now gain the immediate protection of post-quantum
  cryptography without needing to upgrade any of your individual corporate
  applications or systems.


  - Fixed a device registration issue causing WARP connection failures when
  changing networks.

  - Captive portal improvements including showing connectivity status in the
  client and sending system notifications for captive portal sign in

  - The WARP client now applies post-quantum cryptography end-to-end on enabled
  devices accessing resources behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. This feature can be
  enabled by MDM.

  - Improvement to gracefully handle changes made by MDM while WARP is not
  running.

  - Fixed an issue affecting split tunnel include mode, where traffic outside
  the tunnel was blocked when switching between Wifi and ethernet networks.
