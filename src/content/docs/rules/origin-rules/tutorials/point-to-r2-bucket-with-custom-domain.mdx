title: Point to R2 bucket with a custom domain
products:
  - R2
  - Origin Rules
---

import { Example } from "~/components";

This example configures an origin rule and a DNS record to point to an R2 bucket configured with a custom domain.

The procedure will use the following example values:

|                                       |                                  |
| ------------------------------------: | -------------------------------- |
| URL that website visitors will access | `mycustomerexample.com/images/*` |
|               R2 bucket custom domain | `imagesbucket.example.com`       |

When configuring your R2 bucket's custom domain, use a custom domain that you do not plan to use in production (`imagesbucket.example.com` in this example).

## 1. Configure custom domain in your Pages project

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **R2 Object Storage** and select your bucket.
3. On the bucket page, select **Settings**.
4. Under **Public access** > **Custom Domains**, select **Connect Domain**.
5. Enter the domain name you want to connect to — `imagesbucket.example.com` in this example — and select **Continue**.
6. Review the new record that will be added to the DNS table and select **Connect Domain**.

Your domain is now connected. The status takes a few minutes to change from **Initializing** to **Active**, and you may need to refresh to review the status update. If the status has not changed, select the **...** next to your bucket and select **Retry connection**.

To view the added DNS record, select **...** next to the connected domain and select **Manage DNS**.

:::note
The domain used must belong to the same account as the R2 bucket.

## 2. Create origin rule to rewrite host header and override DNS record

In your `mycustomerexample.com` zone, create an origin rule with the following configuration:

<Example>

**If incoming requests match**

| Field    | Operator | Value       |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| URI Path | wildcard | `/images/*` |

If using the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:

```txt
(http.request.uri.path wildcard "/images/*")
```

**Set origin parameters**

- Value after **Host header** > **Rewrite to**: `imagesbucket.example.com`
- Value after **DNS record** > **Override to**: `imagesbucket.example.com`

</Example>

## 3. (Optional) Configure URL rewrite

In our example, the URL that website visitors will access starts with `/images`. However, images stored in the example R2 bucket do not have this initial URL segment.

Use a URL rewrite to remove the `/images` segment from the URL path. Cloudflare provides a rule template in the dashboard called **Rewrite Path for Object Storage Bucket** that you can use to configure the required rewrite.

1. Go to **Rules** > **Overview**.
2. Select **Create rule** > **URL Rewrite Rule**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.
4. In **If incoming requests match**, select **Wildcard pattern**.
5. Enter the following value in **Request URL**:

   ```txt
   https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/images/*
   ```

   In the current example, the value would be `https://mycustomerexample.com/images/*`.

6. In **Then rewrite the path and/or query**, enter the following values under **Path**:

   | Target path      | Rewrite to   |
   | ---------------- | ------------ |
   | [`/`] `images/*` | [`/`] `${1}` |

7. Select **Deploy**.

:::note
Cloudflare provides a rule template in the dashboard called **Rewrite Path for Object Storage Bucket** that you can use and adapt to configure the URL rewrite rule.
