Use Request Header Transform Rules to manipulate the headers of HTTP requests sent to your origin server.

To modify HTTP headers in the **response** sent to website visitors, refer to [Response Header Transform Rules](/rules/transform/response-header-modification/).

Through Request Header Transform Rules you can:

- Set the value of an HTTP request header to a literal string value, overwriting its previous value or adding a new header to the request.
- Set the value of an HTTP request header according to an expression, overwriting its previous value or adding a new header to the request.
- Remove an HTTP header from the request.

You can create a request header transform rule [in the dashboard](/rules/transform/request-header-modification/create-dashboard/), [via API](/rules/transform/request-header-modification/create-api/), or [using Terraform](/terraform/additional-configurations/transform-rules/#create-a-request-header-transform-rule).

## Important remarks

- You cannot modify or remove HTTP request headers whose name starts with `x-cf-` or `cf-` except for the `cf-connecting-ip` HTTP request header, which you can remove.

- Due to protocol compliance reasons, modifying or removing request headers with [forbidden header names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_header_name) (such as `Accept-Encoding`) is generally not allowed in Request Header Transform Rules.

- You cannot modify the value of any header commonly used to identify the website visitor's IP address or initial protocol, such as `x-forwarded-for`, `true-client-ip`, `x-real-ip`, or `x-forwarded-proto`. Additionally, you cannot remove the `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers.

- You cannot set or modify the value of `cookie` HTTP request headers, but you can remove these headers. Configuring a rule that removes the `cookie` HTTP request header will remove all `cookie` headers in matching requests.

- If you modify the value of an existing HTTP request header using an expression that evaluates to an empty string (`""`) or an undefined value, the HTTP request header is **removed**.

- The HTTP request header removal operation will remove all request headers with the provided name.

- Currently, there is a limited number of HTTP request headers that you cannot modify. Cloudflare may remove restrictions for some of these HTTP request headers when presented with valid use cases. [Create a post in the community](https://community.cloudflare.com) for consideration.

- To use [claims inside a JSON Web Token (JWT)](/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/transform-rules/), you must first set up a token validation configuration in API Shield.
