Different web servers and applications handle encoded forward slashes (`%2F`) in URLs differently. Cloudflare follows [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986), which specifies that `%2F` **should not** be automatically normalized to `/` because `/` is a reserved character in URLs, and decoding it might change the intended meaning of the path.

However, many origin servers **do** automatically decode `%2F` into `/` when processing requests. If your origin server behaves this way, you may want to apply the same normalization at Cloudflareâ€™s edge to ensure consistency in request handling, rule evaluation, and logging.

## How to normalize `%2F`

To normalize encoded forward slashes (`%2F`) to standard slashes (`/`) in the request path before [subsequent](/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) rule evaluation, create a new URL rewrite rule and define a dynamic URL path rewrite using [`url_decode()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#url_decode) function:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
(lower(raw.http.request.full_uri) wildcard "*%2f*")
```

Text after **Path** > **Rewrite to** > _Dynamic_:

```txt
url_decode(http.request.uri.path)
```

</Example>

This transformation ensures that `%2F` is always treated as `/` in the request path. This is particularly useful when setting up rules that depend on URL path matching, as it prevents discrepancies caused by differing normalization behaviors.
