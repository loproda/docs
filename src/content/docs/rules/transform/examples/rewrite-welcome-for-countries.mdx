import { Example } from "~/components";

To have a welcome page in two languages, create two URL rewrite rules with a static rewrite of the path component:

**URL rewrite rule #1**

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
http.request.uri.path == "/welcome.html" && ip.src.country == "GB"
```

Text after **Path** > **Rewrite to** > _Static_:

```txt
/welcome-gb.html
```

</Example>

**URL rewrite rule #2**

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
http.request.uri.path == "/welcome.html" && ip.src.country == "PT"
```

Text after **Path** > **Rewrite to** > _Static_:

```txt
/welcome-pt.html
```

</Example>
