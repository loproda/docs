import { Example } from "~/components";

The following response header transform rule sets a header named `X-Bot-Score` to the current bot score in the HTTP response:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/en/")
```

Selected operation under **Modify response header**: _Set dynamic_

**Header name**: `X-Bot-Score`

**Value**: `to_string(cf.bot_management.score)`

</Example>

This rule would overwrite any existing `X-Bot-Score` headers already present in the HTTP response.
