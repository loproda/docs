Cloud Connector (beta) allows you to route matching incoming traffic from your website to a public cloud provider that you define: [Cloudflare R2](/r2/) object storage or an external provider such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. With Cloud Connector you can make Cloudflare the control center for your web traffic, including traffic served from public cloud providers, without having to configure additional rules.

<Render
	file="rules-requirements"
	params={{ sentenceIntro: "Cloud Connector requires" }}
/>

## How it works

First, you configure a Cloud Connector rule that specifies:

- The cloud provider and a supported cloud service that will accept traffic.
- The traffic that will be routed to that cloud service.

Then, Cloudflare will create the [necessary configurations](#applied-configurations) so that the content is accessible for requests matching your Cloud Connector rule. Your object storage bucket should be public for Cloud Connector to work.

Cloud Connector rules are evaluated last in the request evaluation workflow. When there is a rule match and you have other rules changing the same settings, the Cloud Connector rule will win over other rules.

## Applied configurations

Cloud Connector will perform the following configurations automatically, depending on the cloud provider:

- Modify the `Host` header.
- Adjust SSL/TLS for bucket-related traffic ([AWS S3 website endpoints](/rules/cloud-connector/providers/#ssl-connections-to-aws-s3-endpoints) only).

:::note[Additional configurations you may need]

Cloud Connector will not apply any of the following configurations:

- **Cache content served from storage bucket**: To define custom cache behavior — like when to cache returned objects and for [how long](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/settings/#edge-ttl) — you will need to create a [cache rule](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/). For an example rule configuration, refer to [Cache Level (Cache Everything)](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/examples/cache-everything/).

- **Create URL rewrites**: To adjust the URL structure from what your website visitors use to obtain a resource and the folder structure being used in the storage bucket, you will need to create a [URL rewrite](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/). For example, you could create a URL rewrite to remove the `/files` prefix from URI paths before routing the request to your object storage bucket. For an example configuration, refer to [Rewrite path for object storage bucket](/rules/transform/examples/rewrite-path-object-storage/).
