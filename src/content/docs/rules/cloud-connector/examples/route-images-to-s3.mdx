To route requests to `/images` on your domain to an AWS S3 bucket:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Rules** > **Cloud Connector**.
3. Select **Amazon Web Services - S3** as your [cloud provider](/rules/cloud-connector/providers/).
4. Enter the bucket URL. You can structure the URL in two ways:
   - **Subdomain-style URL**: Set the hostname to `<BUCKET_NAME>.s3.amazonaws.com`. In this case, your files should be organized in the root of the bucket, meaning the URI path will map directly to the file. For example, `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/images/file.jpg` will map to `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.s3.amazonaws.com/images/file.jpg`.
   - **URI path-style URL**: Set the hostname to `s3.amazonaws.com`. Here, your bucket must include a folder named `images`, and files should be placed inside this folder. The URI path will then include the bucket name, like `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/<BUCKET_NAME>/images/file.jpg` mapping to `https://s3.amazonaws.com/<BUCKET_NAME>/images/file.jpg`.
5. _(Optional)_ Use [URL Rewrite Rules](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/) to adjust the URL structure. For example, you can [create a URL rewrite](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/) that changes `/images` to `/<BUCKET_NAME>/images` to match the URI path-style URL structure.
6. _(Optional)_ Use [Cache Rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) to adjust the caching behavior for objects returned from the bucket. For example, you can [create a cache rule](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/create-dashboard/) that caches every returned object matching the `/images/*` URI path for seven days:
   - **If incoming requests match** > Custom filter expression: `(starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/images/"))`
   - **Cache eligibility**: Eligible for cache
     - **Edge TTL** > Ignore cache-control header and use this TTL: _7 days_
7. Select **Next** and enter a descriptive name like `Route images to S3` in **Cloud Connector name**.
8. Under **If**, select **Custom filter expression** and enter the following expression:<br />
   `http.request.full_uri wildcard "http*://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/images/*"`<br />
   Replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with desired hostname.
9. Select **Deploy** to activate the rule.

This setup will route all traffic matching `http*://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/images/*` (HTTPS and HTTP requests) to your S3 bucket. Make sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with your actual hostname and adjust the example paths according to your setup.
