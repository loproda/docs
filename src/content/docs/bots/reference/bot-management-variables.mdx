## Ruleset Engine fields

Bot Management provides access to several [new variables](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/?field-category=Bots) within the expression builder of Ruleset Engine-based products such as [WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/).

- **Bot Score** (`cf.bot_management.score`): An integer between 1-99 that indicates [Cloudflare's level of certainty](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) that a request comes from a bot.
- **Verified Bot** (`cf.bot_management.verified_bot`): A boolean value that is true if the request comes from a good bot, like Google or Bing. Most customers choose to allow this traffic. For more details, see [Traffic from known bots](/waf/troubleshooting/faq/#how-does-the-waf-handle-traffic-from-known-bots).
- **Serves Static Resource** (`cf.bot_management.static_resource`): An identifier that matches [file extensions](/bots/additional-configurations/static-resources/) for many types of static resources. Use this variable if you send emails that retrieve static images.
- **ja3Hash** (`cf.bot_management.ja3_hash`) and **ja4** (`cf.bot_management.ja4`): A [**JA3/JA4 fingerprint**](/bots/additional-configurations/ja3-ja4-fingerprint/) helps you profile specific SSL/TLS clients across different destination IPs, Ports, and X509 certificates.
- **Bot Detection IDs** (`cf.bot_management.detection_ids`): List of IDs that correlate to the Bot Management heuristic detections made on a request (you can have multiple heuristic detections on the same request).
- **Verified Bot Categories** (`cf.verified_bot_category`): A string that allows you to segment your verified bot traffic by its [type and purpose](/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/categories/).

## Workers variables

These variables are also available as part of the [request.cf](/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties) object via Cloudflare Workers:

- `request.cf.botManagement.score`
- `request.cf.botManagement.verifiedBot`
- `request.cf.botManagement.staticResource`
- `request.cf.botManagement.ja3Hash`
- `request.cf.botManagement.ja4`
- `request.cf.botManagement.jsDetection.passed`
- `request.cf.botManagement.detectionIds`
- `request.cf.verifiedBotCategory`

## Corporate Proxy

The Bot Management Corporate Proxy field contains identified cloud-based corporate proxies and secure web gateways that are Enterprise-only, and provide outbound security services to their clients.

You can access the Corporate Proxy field in [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/), [rate limiting rules](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), or [Workers](/workers/) to provide different security rules for traffic from these sources. You can also exempt them from rules using Bot Management scores.

```txt title="Example"
not cf.bot_management.verified_bot
and not cf.bot_management.static_resource
and not  cf.bot_management.corporate_proxy
and cf.bot_management.score lt 30
```

## Log fields

Once you enable Bot Management, Cloudflare also surfaces bot information in its [HTTP requests log fields](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/http_requests/):

- BotDetectionIDs
- BotScore
- BotScoreSrc
- BotTags
