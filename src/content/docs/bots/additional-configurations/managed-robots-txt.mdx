Protect your website or application from AI crawlers by implementing a `robots.txt` file on your domain to direct AI bot operators on what content they can and cannot scrape for AI model training.

AI bots are expected to follow the `robots.txt` directives.

:::note
Respecting `robots.txt` is voluntary. If you want to prevent crawling, use AI Audit's [manage AI crawlers](/ai-audit/features/manage-ai-crawlers/) feature.

## Compatibility with existing `robots.txt` files

Cloudflare will independently check whether your website has an existing `robots.txt` file and update the behavior of this feature based on your website.

### Existing robots.txt file

If your website already has a `robots.txt` file — verified by a HTTP `200` response — Cloudflare will prepend our managed `robots.txt` before your existing `robots.txt`, combining both into a single response.

For example, without this feature enabled, the `robots.txt` content of `crawlstop.com` would be:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /lp
Disallow: /feedback
Disallow: /langtest

Sitemap: https://www.crawlstop.com/sitemap.xml
```

With the managed `robots.txt` enabled, Cloudflare will prepend our managed content before your original content, resulting in what you can view at https://www.crawlstop.com/robots.txt.

**Robots.txt example**
<div style="position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%; border: 1px solid orange; border-radius: 5px">
<iframe
	src="https://www.crawlstop.com/robots.txt"
	style="border: none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;"
	allowfullscreen="true"
	title="crawltop.com robots.txt file"
	>
</iframe>
</div>

### No robots.txt file

If your website does not have a `robots.txt` file, Cloudflare creates a new file with our managed block directives and serves it for you.
