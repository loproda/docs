:::note[Block AI bots availability]
The **Block AI bots** feature is only available in the new [application security dashboard](/security/).
:::

You can choose to block AI bots by activating **Block AI bots**. Activating this setting will block [verified bots](/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/overview/) that are classified as AI crawlers, as well as a number of unverified bots that behave similarly.

To block [AI bots](/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots):

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Settings**.
3. Filter by **Bot traffic**.
4. Go to **Block AI bots**.
5. Under **Configurations**, select the edit icon. Choose from:
   - **Only block on hostnames with ads**: Use this option if you wish to block AI bots only on portions of your site that show ads. Cloudflare automatically detects whether ads are present on a subdomain, and only block on hostnames that contain those ad units.
   - **Block on all pages**: Use this option if you wish to block AI bots on all your pages.
   - **Do not block (off)**: Use this option if you wish to allow AI bots on all your pages.
6. Select **Save** to save your configuration.
</Steps>

To block individual AI crawlers (rather than blocking all crawlers), use [AI Audit](/ai-audit/).
