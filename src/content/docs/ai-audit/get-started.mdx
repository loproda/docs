This guide instructs you on how to:

- View AI crawlers that are interacting with pages in your domain (a [Cloudflare zone](/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones)).
- Use AI Audit to block individual crawlers from accessing your content.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/).
2. [Connect your domain to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).
3. Make sure your domain is [proxying traffic through Cloudflare](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#cloudflare-as-a-reverse-proxy).

## 1. Block specific AI crawlers

<Tabs syncKey="plans">
<TabItem label="All plans">

To only block specific AI crawlers:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
1. Go to **AI Audit**.
2. From the **AI Crawlers** tab, go to the list of AI crawlers.
3. Review the AI crawlers that are accessing your domain.
4. From the **Block** column, select the option **Block**.
</Steps>

:::note[Quality of AI crawler detection]
On the free plan, AI Audit identifies AI crawlers based on their [user agent strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent). This enables AI Audit to detect easy-to-detect (well-known) AI crawlers.

Upgrade your plan to enable a more thorough detection using Cloudflare's [Bot Management detection ID](/bots/reference/bot-management-variables/#ruleset-engine-fields) field.

<Steps>
1. Go to **AI Audit**.
2. From the **AI Crawlers** tab, go to the list of AI crawlers.
3. Review key information such as:
   - Bot operator
   - Number of requests sent by the AI crawler
   - Whether the AI crawler is allowed according to your `robots.txt`, or the number of times the AI crawler has violated your `robots.txt`.
4. From the **Block** column, toggle the switch for AI crawlers you wish to block.

You can also create more complex rules when taking action on AI crawlers, using [Cloudflare WAF](/waf/). For more information on creating more specific rules, refer to [Create a custom rule in the dashboard](/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/).
