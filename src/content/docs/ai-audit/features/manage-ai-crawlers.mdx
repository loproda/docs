2. Go to **AI Audit**.
3. Go to the **AI Crawlers** tab.

## Review AI crawler activity

The **AI Crawlers** tab displays a table of AI crawlers that are requesting access to your content, and how they interact with your pages. The table provides the following information.

:::note[Quality of AI crawler detection]
On the free plan, AI Audit identifies AI crawlers based on their [user agent strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent). This enables AI Audit to detect easy-to-detect (well-known) AI crawlers.

Upgrade your plan to enable a more thorough detection using Cloudflare's [Bot Management detection ID](/bots/reference/bot-management-variables/#ruleset-engine-fields) field.
:::

### Filter AI crawler data

You can use filters to narrow the scope of your result:

- **Name:** Search the name of the AI crawler.
- **Operator:** Filter by the AI crawler operator.
- **Category:** Filter by the category of the AI crawler (for example, AI crawler, AI assistant, or archiver).

The values of the table will update according to your filter.
