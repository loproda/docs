Connect your Cloudflare account to Stripe to process payments. Pay per crawl uses Stripe to process payments between AI crawler owners and site owners.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account.
2. Go to **Manage Account** > **Configurations**.
3. Go to the **Pay Per Crawl** tab.
4. From **Connect to Stripe**, select **Connect**.
5. Select **Continue to Stripe**.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect your Cloudflare account to a Stripe account.
   :::note[Use a non-personal email address]
   Cloudflare recommends using a dedicated email to manage your pay per crawl account (for example, `aicrawler@company.com`).

</Steps>

When you successfully connect Stripe to your account, you will see a green tick âœ… next to **Stripe connection**.

:::caution[Spending limits]
Cloudflare is not responsible for configuring spending limits. Ensure you have configured a maximum spending limit on your AI crawler.

## Billing

Charges are recorded upon successful delivery of content that is requested with valid [crawler price headers](/ai-audit/features/pay-per-crawl/use-pay-per-crawl-as-ai-owner/crawl-pages/#22-include-payment-headers).

Invoices are created and managed via Stripe. Crawlers are responsible for setting and enforcing their own spending limits.
