To begin using pay per crawl, set up your Cloudflare account.

## 1. Sign up to a Cloudflare account

Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).

## 2. Connect your domain to Cloudflare

[Connect your domain](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/) to Cloudflare. Domains you add to Cloudflare become [zones](/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones).

AI Audit scopes pay per crawl to your zones.

## 3. Proxy traffic through Cloudflare

Make sure your domain is [proxying traffic through Cloudflare](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#cloudflare-as-a-reverse-proxy).
