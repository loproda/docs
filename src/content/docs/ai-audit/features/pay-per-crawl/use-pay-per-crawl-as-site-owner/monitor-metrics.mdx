Once you have confirmed the selection of AI crawlers to charge, monitor key metrics to understand how AI crawlers are interacting with your content.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Metrics** tab.
2. [View AI Audit metrics](/ai-audit/features/analyze-ai-traffic/#view-ai-audit-metrics). Understanding these metrics can help you better manage AI crawlers accessing your content.
