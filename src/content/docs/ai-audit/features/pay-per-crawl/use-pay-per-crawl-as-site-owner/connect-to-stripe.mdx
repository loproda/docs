## Billing

Cloudflare manages the billing lifecycle from charge initiation to payout.

The billing workflow begins when an AI crawler indicates payment intent via request header. A charge event is recorded upon successful delivery of the requested content. Cloudflare subsequently aggregates and reconciles all recorded charges.

Payouts are remitted to publishers in good standing on a monthly cycle and subject to a settlement period and payout threshold.
