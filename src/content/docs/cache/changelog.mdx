**Smart Tiered Cache for Load balancing**

Smart Tiered Cache will now select a common single best Upper Tier for an entire Load Balancing Pool based on Origin performance measurements, increasing the cache HIT ratio.

## 2024-11-20

**Smart Tiered Cache for R2**

R2 now automatically gets tiered cache if using Smart Tiered Cache. We select a data center close to your R2 storage bucket as a common Upper Tier cache.

## 2024-11-07

**Shard Cache by cache key**

For custom cache keys, enterprise customers can now shard their cache using up to three values for previously restricted headers `accept*`, `referer`, and `user-agent`. Sharding the cache can improve cache `HIT` ratio and performance. However, overly sharding your cache, can have the opposite effect.

## 2024-11-07

**Versioning**

Cache now supports versioned environments allowing customers to stage configurations and purge staged environments. Note that Cache Reserve is only supported for your production environment.

**New Cache Rules templates for one-click rule creation**

The new **Rules** > **Templates** page in the Cloudflare dashboard provides one-click templates for creating cache rules, making it easy to optimize your caching strategy. Access these pre-built templates directly from each product's rule builder, and explore the [Examples gallery](/rules/examples/) in the developer documentation for real-world use cases.

## 2024-07-19

**Generic tiered cache**

[Generic Global Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/#generic-global-tiered-cache) topology leverages all Cloudflare data centers as upper-tier cache network. It now hashes content within a region reducing duplication in upper-tier caches, which increases cache `HIT` ratio.
