Cloudflare's Instant Purge ensures that updates to your content are reflected immediately. Multiple options are available for purging content, with single-file cache purging (purge by URL) being the recommended method. However, the following additional options are also available:

<DirectoryListing />

:::note
If versioning is active on your zone and multiple environments are configured, you can select the specific environment you want to purge. For more details, refer to the [Version Management](/version-management/) documentation.

## Availability and limits

<FeatureTable id="cache.purge_cache" />

### Hostname, tag, prefix URL, and purge everything limits

The current purge limits are applied per **account**: 

<FeatureTable id="cache.purge_limits" />

### Single-file purge limits

The current purge limits are applied per **account**:

<FeatureTable id="cache.single_file_purge" />

Note that the thresholds for URLs are calculated using a moving average.

### Token bucket rate limiting

Cloudflare uses token bucket rate limiting to limit the number of purge requests flowing through the system at any given time, ensuring a steady and manageable flow. 

Each account tier has a defined request rate (for example, Free: 5 requests per minute, Business: 10 requests per second), and requests are only allowed if there are available tokens in the bucket. Tokens refill at a consistent rate, but each bucket has a maximum capacity (for example, Free: 25 tokens, Enterprise: 500 tokens), allowing short bursts of requests if tokens have accumulated. 

If the bucket is empty, further requests must wait until new tokens are added. This system maintains fair usage while allowing occasional bursts within the bucket's capacity.

If you are an Enterprise customer and you need more operations, reach out to your account team for support.
