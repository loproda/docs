## Exceeding requests per second or throughput limits
If you consistently exceed the requests per second or throughput limits, your pipeline might not be able to keep up with the load. The pipeline will communicate backpressure by returning a 429 response to HTTP requests or throwing an error if using the Workers API.

If you are consistently seeing backpressure from your pipeline, consider the following strategies:
* Increase the [shard count](/pipelines/build-with-pipelines/shards) to increase the maximum throughput of your pipeline.
* Send data to a second pipeline if you receive an error. You can setup multiple pipelines to write to the same R2 bucket.
