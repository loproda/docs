Pipelines support data ingestion over HTTP. When you create a new pipeline using the default settings you will receive a globally scalable ingestion endpoint. To ingest data, make HTTP POST requests to the endpoint.

```sh
$ npx wrangler@latest pipelines create my-clickstream-pipeline --r2-bucket my-bucket

ðŸŒ€ Authorizing R2 bucket "my-bucket"
ðŸŒ€ Creating pipeline named "my-clickstream-pipeline"
âœ… Successfully created pipeline my-clickstream-pipeline

ðŸŽ‰ You can now send data to your pipeline!

Send data to your pipeline's HTTP endpoint:
curl "https://0e00c5ff09b34d018152af98d06f5a1xvc.pipelines.cloudflare.com/" -d '[{ ...JSON_DATA... }]'
```

## Authentication
You can secure your HTTP ingestion endpoint using Cloudflare API tokens. By default, authentication is turned off. To configure authentication, use the `--require-http-auth` flag while creating or updating a pipeline.

```sh
$ npx wrangler pipelines create [PIPELINE-NAME] --r2-bucket [R2-BUCKET-NAME] --require-http-auth true
```

Once authentication is turned on, you will need to include a Cloudflare API token in your request headers.

### Get API token
1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Navigate to your [API Keys](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
3. Select **Create Token**.
4. Choose the template for Workers Pipelines. Select **Continue to summary** > **Create token**. Make sure to copy the API token and save it securely.

### Making authenticated requests
Include the API token you created in the previous step in the headers for your request:

```sh
curl https://<PIPELINE-ID>.pipelines.cloudflare.com
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
	-d '[{"foo":"bar"}, {"foo":"bar"}, {"foo":"bar"}]'
```

## Specifying CORS Settings
If you want to use your pipeline to ingest client side data, such as website clicks, you will need to configure your [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

Without setting your CORS settings, browsers will restrict requests made to your pipeline endpoint. For example, if your website domain is `https://my-website.com`, and you want to post client side data to your pipeline at `https://<PIPELINE-ID>.pipelines.cloudflare.com`, without CORS settings, the request will fail.

To fix this, you need to configure your pipeline to accept requests from `https://my-website.com`. You can do so while creating or updating a pipeline, using the flag `--cors-origins`. You can specify multiple domains separated by a space.

```sh
$ npx wrangler pipelines update [PIPELINE-NAME] --cors-origins https://mydomain.com http://localhost:8787
```

You can specify that all cross origin requests are accepted. We recommend only using this option in development, and not for production use cases.
```sh
$ npx wrangler pipelines update [PIPELINE-NAME] --cors-origins "*"
```

After the `--cors-origins` have been set on your pipeline, your pipeline will respond to preflight requests and `POST` requests with the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers set.
