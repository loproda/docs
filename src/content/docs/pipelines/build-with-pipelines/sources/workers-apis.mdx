Pipelines exposes an API directly to your [Workers](/workers) scripts via the [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#what-is-a-binding) concept. Bindings allow you to securely send data to a pipeline without having to manage API keys or clients. Sending data via a Worker is enabled by default.

## Send data from a Worker
### Setup a binding
Bind to a pipeline by defining a `pipelines` binding within your Wrangler configuration. For example:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
#:schema node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json
name = "pipeline-starter"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2025-04-01"

[[pipelines]]
pipeline = "<MY-PIPELINE-NAME>" # The name of your Pipeline
binding = "PIPELINE" # The binding name, accessed using env.MY_PIPELINE
```

</WranglerConfig>

You can bind multiple pipelines to a Worker.

### Send data
The Pipelines binding exposes a `send()` method. For example, to log inbound HTTP requests to your Worker:

```ts
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		let log = {
			url: request.url,
			method: request.method,
			headers: Object.fromEntries(request.headers),
		  };
		await env.PIPELINE.send([log]);
		return new Response('Hello World!');
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Workers API
### `Pipeline`
A binding which allows a Worker to send messages to a pipeline.

```ts
interface Pipeline<PipelineRecord> {
  send(records: PipelineRecord[]): Promise<void>;
}
```

* `send(records)`: `Promise<void>`

  * Sends records to the pipeline. The body must be an array of objects which are JSON serializable.
  * When the promise resolves, the records are confirmed to be ingested.

:::note
When running your Worker locally, pipelines are partially simulated. Worker code which sends data to a pipeline will execute successfully. However, the full pipeline, including batching & writing to R2, will not be executed locally.
