<Description>

Ingest real time data streams and load into R2, using Cloudflare Pipelines.

</Description>

<Plan type="paid" />

Cloudflare Pipelines lets you ingest high volumes of real time data, without managing any infrastructure. Ingested data is automatically batched, written to output files, and delivered to an [R2 bucket](/r2/) in your account. You can use Pipelines to build a data lake of clickstream data, or to store events from a Worker.

## Create your first pipeline
You can setup a pipeline to ingest data via HTTP, and deliver output to R2, with a single command:

```sh
$ npx wrangler@latest pipelines create my-clickstream-pipeline --r2-bucket my-bucket

ðŸŒ€ Authorizing R2 bucket "my-bucket"
ðŸŒ€ Creating pipeline named "my-clickstream-pipeline"
âœ… Successfully created pipeline my-clickstream-pipeline

Id:    0e00c5ff09b34d018152af98d06f5a1xvc
Name:  my-clickstream-pipeline
Sources:
  HTTP:
    Endpoint:        https://0e00c5ff09b34d018152af98d06f5a1xvc.pipelines.cloudflare.com/
    Authentication:  off
    Format:          JSON
  Worker:
    Format:  JSON
Destination:
  Type:         R2
  Bucket:       my-bucket
  Format:       newline-delimited JSON
  Compression:  GZIP
Batch hints:
  Max bytes:     100 MB
  Max duration:  300 seconds
  Max records:   100,000

ðŸŽ‰ You can now send data to your pipeline!

Send data to your pipeline's HTTP endpoint:
curl "https://0e00c5ff09b34d018152af98d06f5a1xvc.pipelines.cloudflare.com/" -d '[{ ...JSON_DATA... }]'

To send data to your pipeline from a Worker, add the following configuration to your config file:
{
  "pipelines": [
    {
      "pipeline": "my-clickstream-pipeline",
      "binding": "PIPELINE"
    }
  ]
}
```

Refer to the [getting started guide](/pipelines/getting-started) to start building with pipelines.

:::note
While in beta, you will not be billed for Pipelines usage. You will be billed only for [R2 usage](/r2/pricing/).
