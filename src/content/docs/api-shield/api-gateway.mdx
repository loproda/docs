Cloudflare API Shield empowers you to use Cloudflare as your API Gateway, providing robust security features, streamlined management tools, and integration with the Cloudflare Developer Platform for building new APIs.​

APIs are fundamental to modern applications but are increasingly targeted by malicious actors. Cloudflare API Shield offers a comprehensive solution to protect, manage, and build your APIs.

- **Enhanced security**: Implement robust runtime protection such as JWT validation, mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication, schema validation, and protection against the [OWASP Top 10 API Security risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/).

- **Efficient management and monitoring**: Utilize tools for endpoint management, analytics, and routing to streamline API operations. Highlight risks with Posture Management, and gain visibility with Security Analytics and Security Center Insights.

- **Integrated development**: Leverage the Cloudflare Developer Platform to build and deploy new APIs with ease, taking advantage of scalable infrastructure and a suite of developer tools.
