## Why care about API security?

APIs have become the [backbone of popular web services](https://blog.postman.com/intro-to-apis-history-of-apis/), helping the Internet become more accessible and useful.

As APIs have become more prevalent, however, so have their problems:

- Many companies have [thousands of APIs](/api-shield/security/api-discovery/), including ones they do not even know about.
- To support a large base of users, many APIs are protected by a negative security model that makes them vulnerable to credential-stuffing attacks and automated scanning tools.
- With so many endpoints and users, itâ€™s difficult to recognize brute-force attacks against [specific endpoints](/api-shield/security/volumetric-abuse-detection/).
- Sophisticated attacks are even harder to recognize, often because even development teams are unaware of common and uncommon [usage patterns](/api-shield/security/sequence-analytics/).

Refer to the [Get started](/api-shield/get-started/) guide to set up API Shield.
