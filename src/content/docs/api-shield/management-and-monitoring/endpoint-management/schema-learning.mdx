Cloudflare learns schema parameters via traffic inspection. For all endpoints saved to Endpoint Management, you can export the learned schema in OpenAPI `v3.0.0` format by hostname.

To protect your API with a learned schema, refer to [Schema validation](/api-shield/security/schema-validation/#add-validation-by-applying-a-learned-schema-to-an-entire-hostname).

## Export a schema

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav">
  <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

      1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
      2. Select **Security** > **API Shield** > **Endpoint Management**.
      4. Select **Export schema** and choose a hostname to export.
      5. Select whether to include [learned parameters](/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/#learned-schemas-will-always-include) and [rate limit recommendations](/api-shield/security/volumetric-abuse-detection/)
      6. Select **Export schema** and choose a location to save the file.

:::note
The schema is saved as a JSON file in OpenAPI `v3.0.0` format.
:::

Learned schemas will always include:

- The listed hostname in the servers section
- All endpoints by host, method, and path

For endpoints that receive sufficient traffic, learned schemas will also include:

- Detected path variables and formats
- Detected query parameters and formats
- Detected `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` body variable names and formats for `application/json` content types

Learned schemas can optionally include:

- API Shield's rate limit threshold recommendations

## Limitations

Endpoints must be added for at least 24 hours before schema learning begins. Schema learning is a continuous process that inspects the last 72 hours of traffic to an endpoint.

Schema learning only learns from requests with `2xx` response codes.

Schema learning works best with high volumes of traffic. You may see less confident learned schemas for endpoints with less than 10,000 requests in the last 72 hours.
