API Shield's labeling service will help you organize your endpoints and address vulnerabilities in your API. The labeling service comes with managed and user-defined labels.

Today, managed labels are useful for organizing endpoints by use case. In a future release, managed labels will automatically label endpoints by use case and those with informative or security risks, alerting you on endpoints that need attention.

User-defined labels can also be added to endpoints in API Shield by creating a label and adding it to an individual endpoint or multiple endpoints. User-defined labels will be useful for organizing your endpoints by owner, version, or type.

You can filter your endpoints based on the labels.

## Categories

### Managed labels

Use managed labels to identify endpoints by use case. Cloudflare may automatically apply these labels in a future release.

`cf-log-in`: Add this label to endpoints that accept user credentials. You may have multiple endpoints if you accept username, password, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) across multiple endpoints or requests.

`cf-sign-up`: Add this label to endpoints that are the final step in creating user accounts for your site or application.

`cf-content`: Add this label to endpoints that provide unique content, such as product details, user reviews, pricing, or other unique information.

`cf-purchase`: Add this label to endpoints that are the final step in purchasing goods or services online.

`cf-password-reset`: Add this label to endpoints that participate in the user password reset process. This includes initial password reset requests and final password reset submissions.

`cf-add-cart`: Add this label to endpoints that add items to a user's shopping cart or verify item availability.

`cf-add-payment`: Add this label to endpoints that accept credit card or bank account details where fraudsters may iterate through account numbers to guess valid combinations of payment information.

`cf-check-value`: Add this label to endpoints that check the balance of rewards points, in-game currency, or other stored value products that can be earned, transferred, and redeemed for cash or physical goods.

`cf-add-post`: Add this label to endpoints that post messages in a communication forum, or product or merchant reviews.

`cf-account-update`: Add this label to endpoints that participate in user account or profile updates.

`cf-llm`: Services that are (partially) powered by Large Language Model (LLM).

`cf-rss-feed`: Add this label to endpoints that expect traffic from RSS clients.

:::note
[Bot Fight Mode](/bots/get-started/bot-fight-mode/) will not block requests to endpoints labeled as `cf-rss-feed`.

[Super Bot Fight Mode rules](/bots/get-started/super-bot-fight-mode/#ruleset-engine) will not match or challenge requests labeled as `cf-rss-feed`.
:::

### Risk labels

Cloudflare automatically runs risk scans every 24 hours on your saved endpoints. API Shield applies these labels when a scan finds security risks on your endpoints. A corresponding Security Center Insight is also raised when risks are found.

`cf-risk-missing-auth`: Automatically added when all successful requests lack a session identifier. Refer to the table below for more information.

`cf-risk-mixed-auth`: Automatically added when some successful requests contain a session identifier and some successful requests lack a session identifier. Refer to the table below for more information.

`cf-risk-sensitive`: Automatically added to endpoints when HTTP responses match the WAF's [Sensitive Data Detection](/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/#sensitive-data-detection) ruleset.

`cf-risk-missing-schema`: Automatically added when a learned schema is available for an endpoint that has no active schema.

`cf-risk-error-anomaly`: Automatically added when an endpoint experiences a recent increase in response errors over the last 24 hours.

`cf-risk-latency-anomaly`: Automatically added when an endpoint experiences a recent increase in response latency over the last 24 hours.

`cf-risk-size-anomaly`: Automatically added when an endpoint experiences a spike in response body size over the last 24 hours.

`cf-risk-bola-enumeration`: Automatically added when an endpoint experiences successful responses with drastic differences in the number of unique elements requested by different user sessions.

`cf-risk-bola-pollution`: Automatically added when an endpoint experiences successful responses where parameters are found in multiple places in the request, as opposed to what is expected from the API's schema.

:::note
Cloudflare will only add authentication labels to endpoints with successful response codes. Refer to the below table for more details.
