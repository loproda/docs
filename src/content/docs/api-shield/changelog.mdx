## 2025-02-17

**New automatically applied risk labels**

## 2025-01-16

**API Authentication Posture**

Customers will see per-endpoint authentication details inside [Endpoints](/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/) for zones with configured session identifiers.

## 2024-12-19

**Automatically applied endpoint risk labels**

API Shield now automatically labels endpoints with risks due to authentication status and sensitive data detection.

## 2024-11-04

**Endpoint labels**

Customers can now organize their endpoints by use case and custom labels using the [Endpoint labeling service](/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/) for easy reference and future machine learning (ML) model training.

## 2024-10-18

**API Shield fields in Custom Rules**

Customers can now use API Shield product feature fields in [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/), referencing features such as [JWT Validation](/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/), [session identifiers](/api-shield/get-started/#session-identifiers), and [Schema Validation](/api-shield/security/schema-validation/).

## 2024-09-25

**Fallthrough rule for Schema Validation 2.0**

Customers can now enable the [Fallthrough Action](/api-shield/security/schema-validation/#add-validation-by-adding-a-fallthrough-rule) for Schema Validation 2.0 to block or log requests that do not match the endpoints listed in schemas protected by Schema Validation 2.0.

## 2024-08-28

**Increased capacity for Endpoint management and Schema Validation**

Endpoint management and Schema Validation now support up to 10,000 saved and validated API endpoints.

## 2024-07-08

**API Discovery's hostname variables**

Customers can now see when [API Discovery](/api-shield/security/api-discovery/) groups similar subdomains with the same methods and paths, making it easy to discover and manage APIs that share many vanity domains or subdomains.

## 2024-07-02

**Route API requests using API Routing**

Customers can now route requests to different back-end services through [API Routing](/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/api-routing/), creating a unified front for their APIs distributed across otherwise disparate systems.

## 2024-05-13

**Use JWT claims in Advanced Rate Limiting, Transform Rules, and as session IDs**

Customers can now use the fields inside [JSON Web Tokens (known as claims)](/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/transform-rules/#enhance-transform-rules-with-jwt-claims) as [session identifiers in API Shield](/api-shield/get-started/#session-identifiers), to count values in [Advanced Rate Limiting](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), and to send on useful information in [Transform Rules](/rules/transform/#transform-rules).

## 2024-04-30

**Build Sequence Mitigation rules via the Cloudflare dashboard**

Customers can now build [Sequence Mitigation](/api-shield/security/sequence-mitigation/) rules with a new user interface inside the API Shield section of the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

## 2024-02-23

**Endpoint management supports hostname variables**

Customers can now save endpoints in [Endpoint management](/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/) that contain variables in the hostname. Hostname variables are supported across all product features.
