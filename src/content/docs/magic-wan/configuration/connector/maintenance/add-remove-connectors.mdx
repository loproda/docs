To add a new Connector you first need to remove the one associated with the on-ramp. You can only have more than one Connector if you initially enabled high availability on your on-ramp.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **Magic WAN** > **Connector on-ramps (beta)**.
3. Find the on-ramp that you want to edit > select the three dots next to it > **Edit**.
4. In **Connectors**, remove the Connector associated with the on-ramp.
5. Select **Add Connector** to add a different Connector to your on-ramp.
6. Select **Save**.
