## Next steps

- Now that you have set up your tunnel endpoints you need to configure routes to route your traffic through Cloudflare. Refer to [Configure routes](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-routes/) to learn more about static routing and BGP peering (only available through Direct CNI connection).

- After configuring either static routes or BGP routing, you will have to [set up a site](/magic-wan/configuration/common-settings/sites/).
