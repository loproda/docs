Limits for individual queries (listed above) apply to each individual statement contained within a batch statement. For example, the maximum SQL statement length of 100 KB applies to each statement inside a `db.batch()`.

[^1]: The maximum number of databases per account can be increased by request on Workers Paid and Enterprise plans, with support for millions to tens-of-millions of databases (or more) per account. Refer to the guidance on limit increases on this page to request an increase.
[^2]: The maximum storage per account can be increased by request on Workers Paid and Enterprise plans. Refer to the guidance on limit increases on this page to request an increase.
[^3]: A single Worker script can have up to 1 MB of script metadata. A binding is defined as a binding to a resource, such as a D1 database, KV namespace, [environmental variable](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/), or secret. Each resource binding is approximately 150-bytes, however environmental variables and secrets are controlled by the size of the value you provide. Excluding environmental variables, you can bind up to \~5,000 D1 databases to a single Worker script.
[^4]: Requests to Cloudflare API must resolve in 30 seconds. Therefore, this duration limit also applies to the entire batch call.
[^5]: The imported file is uploaded to R2. Refer to [R2 upload limit](/r2/platform/limits).
