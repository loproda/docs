## Purpose

The purpose of a changelog is to log or record notable changes, which then appear as part of the [Cloudflare changelog](/changelog/) and on product-specific changelog pages.

:::note[Disambiguation]

This page describes the content strategy for changelogs. For updates on Cloudflare products, refer to [Changelog](/changelog/).

:::

## Tone

instructional, straightforward

## content_type

```yaml
pcx_content_type: changelog
```

For more details, refer to [`pcx_content_type`](/style-guide/frontmatter/custom-properties/#pcx_content_type).

## Ownership

Product managers and engineers maintain changelogs manually or via an automated process that their team owns. PCX provides a review but does not own creating or writing changelogs.

## Structure

When creating a changelog, you need an MDX page file and a corresponding folder of changelog entries.

The combination of these files allows us to:

- Render traditional changelog content on an [HTML page](/dns/changelog/).
- Programmatically create an [RSS feed](/changelog/rss/dns.xml) with the changelog content.
- Pull all our changelog content into a [Cloudflare-wide changelog](/changelog/).

### Markdown file

Your Markdown file needs to have several special values to pull in the changelog information. These values are highlighted in the sample page.

For more information about the `ProductChangelog` component, refer to the [style guide](/style-guide/components/product-changelog/).

```mdx title="/src/content/docs/dns/changelog.mdx"
---
pcx_content_type: changelog
title: Changelog
---

import { ProductChangelog } from "~/components";

{/* <!-- Actual content lives in /src/content/changelog/dns/. --> */}

<ProductChangelog product="dns" />
```

### Changelog entries

Changelog entries live in a different location of our docs, [`/src/content/changelog/`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/tree/production/src/content/changelog).

Each entry will be its own MDX file, similar to the following.

````mdx title="src/content/changelog/dns/"

title: Account-level DNS analytics now available via GraphQL Analytics API
description: Authoritative DNS analytics can now be accessed on the account level via the GraphQL Analytics API.
date: 2025-06-19
---

Authoritative DNS analytics are now available on the **account level** via the [Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/).

This allows users to query DNS analytics across multiple zones in their account, by using the `accounts` filter.

Here is an example to retrieve all DNS queries across all zones in an account that resulted in an `NXDOMAIN` response over a given time frame. Please replace `a30f822fcd7c401984bf85d8f2a5111c` with your actual account ID.

```graphql graphql-api-explorer title="GraphQL example for account-level DNS analytics"
query Viewer {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: "a30f822fcd7c401984bf85d8f2a5111c" }) {
			dnsAnalyticsAdaptive(
				limit: 10
				filter: {
					date_geq: "2025-06-16"
					responseCode: "NXDOMAIN"
					date_leq: "2025-06-18"
				}
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				zoneTag
				queryName
				responseCode
				queryType
				datetime
			}
		}
	}
}
```

To learn more and get started, refer to the [DNS Analytics documentation](/dns/additional-options/analytics/#analytics).

### Properties

Each changelog entries has the following properties:

- `title` <Type text="string" /> <MetaInfo text="required" />
  - Shown in the title heading and on social media embeds.
- `description` <Type text="string" /> <MetaInfo text="required" />
  - Shown in social media embeds.
- `date` <Type text="date" /> <MetaInfo text="required" />
  - This should be a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. For example, `2025-02-04`.
- `preview_image` <Type text="string" /> <MetaInfo text="optional" />
  - Path to an image file
- `products` <Type text="Array<String>" /> <MetaInfo text="(default: current location) optional" />
  - The products list is case-sensitive. Only use lowercase.
  - This should be an array of strings, each referring to the name of a file in the products collection without the file extension.
  - The folder that your entry is in, such as `src/content/changelog/workers/2025-02-13-new-product-feature.mdx`, is inferred as part of this property. If you do not want to associate the entry with additional products, you can omit it from the frontmatter entirely.
  - If you wish to reference a product that does not exist in this collection, such as one that resides in the subpath of an existing product, you can create a "metadata only" entry:

    ```yaml title="src/content/proucts/workers-observability.yaml"
    name: Workers Observability

    product:
    	title: Workers Observability
    	url: /workers/observability/
    	group: Developer platform
    	show: false
    ```

- `hidden` <Type text="Boolean" /> <MetaInfo text="(default: false) optional" />
  - If `true`, this page will be accessible from the direct link, but hidden from the main [changelog](/changelog/) page and all RSS feeds.
  - If `true`, will also add a `noindex` property so the page is not indexed by search crawlers.
