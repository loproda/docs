We use a variety of tools to make our docs site work. You could use these tools to build up your own docs site and - in most cases - do so for free or starting on a free tier.

## Content management system

Our content lives in a public GitHub repository, [`cloudflare-docs`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs).

GitHub offers a generous [free tier](https://github.com/pricing).

## Search

We use [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) as our search provider.

If you have open-source docs, you can be part of the free [DocSearch program](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).

## Site framework

We use [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) for our docs, which is a free, custom documentation theme supported by [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Astro's [component overrides](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) and [plugins](https://starlight.astro.build/resources/plugins/) system were a big part of us [choosing this framework](https://blog.cloudflare.com/open-source-all-the-way-down-upgrading-our-developer-documentation/) and have exponentially increased our [site's capabilities](/style-guide/components/) (without much extra work).


## Builds

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build our site, which is then [hosted](#hosting) on Cloudflare.

We are moving to [Workers CI/CD](/workers/ci-cd/), which currently runs in the background.

Both of these options include a free tier.

## Hosting

We host our content using [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/static-assets/), specifically using their built in values for [Astro sites](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/astro/)

Workers offers a generous [free tier](/workers/platform/pricing/).

## Analytics

We send analytics to multiple destinations using [Cloudflare Zaraz](/zaraz/), which has a generous [free tier](/zaraz/pricing-info/).
