This section shares how Cloudflare approaches docs strategically, covering topics like `how we built our site` and `how we think about redirects`.

The goal is twofold because it:

- Encourages deep thinking about how we approach things (and if they could be better).
- Contributes back to the open-source ecosystem. We get a lot of benefits from being open source and we want to give back.

We hope you learn from the topics below. As always, [submit an issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/issues/new) if you find something inaccurate or unclear.
