Tags are currently used to filter content in the [`ExternalResources`](/style-guide/components/external-resources/), [`ProductsByTag`](/style-guide/components/products-by-tag/) and the [`ResourcesBySelector`](/style-guide/components/resources-by-selector/) components.

## Example

```mdx
---
title: Example
tags:
  - foo
  - bar
---
```

## Allowed tags and where they are being used

Tags are validated against an allowlist in [`/src/schemas/tags.ts`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/blob/production/src/schemas/tags.ts) which defines the user-facing representation (`label`) and any associated variants.

The matching is case-insensitive. For example, all of the following values are accepted in the `tags` frontmatter array and will be transformed into `Node.js`:

- `node.js`
- `NoDe.JS`
- `node`
- `nodejs`
