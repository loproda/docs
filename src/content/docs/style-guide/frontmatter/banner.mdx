import { Steps, FileTree } from "~/components";

One of the fields you can add to the [Frontmatter](/style-guide/frontmatter/) is `banner`. It displays a prominent section at the top of the page and supports the use of HTML for links and formatting.

Only use it to alert about disruptive situations and take note to remove it when applicable.

## Example

```mdx wrap
---
title: Banner
description: How to display a banner at the top of the page and when to use it.
banner:
  content: Do <strong>not</strong> use banners in the <a href="/style-guide/frontmatter/">Frontmatter</a> unless a change will cause customer application to break.
---
```

## Dismissible

You can make a banner dismissible (for some number of days) by adding the `dismissible` property to the banner object.

```mdx wrap
---
title: Banner
description: How to display a banner at the top of the page and when to use it.
banner:
  content: Do <strong>not</strong> use banners in the <a href="/style-guide/frontmatter/">Frontmatter</a> unless a change will cause customer application to break.
  dismissible:
    id: banner-example
		days: 7 # default
---
```

Any other banner with the same `dismissible_id` will be dismissed when the banner is displayed.
