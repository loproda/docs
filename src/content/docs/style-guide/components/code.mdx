Code blocks are powered by [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/), a project by Astro.
This is just a small showcase of functionality, it has a lot of options!

````mdx live
```powershell title="PowerShell"
Write-Output "This one has a title!"
```

```js collapse={3-5}
// Collapsing
const foo = {
	1: 1,
	2: 2,
	3: 3,
};
```

```js showLineNumbers
// Line numbers
const foo = "bar";
const bar = "baz";
```

```js wrap
// Example with wrap
function getLongString() {
	return "This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide";
}
```

```js "return true;" ins="inserted" del="deleted"
function demo() {
	console.log("These are inserted and deleted marker types");
	// The return statement uses the default marker type
	return true;
}
```

```diff lang="js"
  function thisIsJavaScript() {
    // This entire block gets highlighted as JavaScript,
    // and we can still add diff markers to it!
-   console.log('Old code to be removed')
+   console.log('New and shiny code!')
  }
```

:::caution
Do not use the `$` sign in your code blocks before the command.

## Output

If you would like to include the output of your code block, create a second code block below and add the `output` property to the opening code fence.

```sh
npx wrangler vectorize create tutorial-index --dimensions=3 --metric=cosine
```

```sh output
✅ Successfully created index 'tutorial-index'

[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX" # available in your Worker on env.VECTORIZE_INDEX
index_name = "tutorial-index"
```

````mdx
```sh
npx wrangler vectorize create tutorial-index --dimensions=3 --metric=cosine
```

```sh output
✅ Successfully created index 'tutorial-index'

[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX" # available in your Worker on env.VECTORIZE_INDEX
index_name = "tutorial-index"
```
````

## Workers Playground

If you add the `playground` option to the opening code fence for a Worker example, it will
add a "Run Worker in Playground" link that will take the user to the [Worker's playground](/workers/playground/)

### Live demo

```js playground
export default {
	fetch() {
		return new Response("Test!");
	},
};
```

### How to use

````mdx "playground"
```js playground
export default {
	fetch() {
		return new Response("Test!");
	},
};
```
````

## GraphQL API explorer

If you add the `graphql-api-explorer` option to the opening code fence for a `graphql` code block, it will
add a "Run in GraphQL API Explorer" link that will take the user to the [GraphQL API explorer](https://graphql.cloudflare.com/explorer).

### Live demo

```graphql graphql-api-explorer title="A GraphQL query"
query ASingleDatasetExample($zoneTag: string, $start: Time, $end: Time) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			firewallEventsAdaptive(
				filter: { datetime_gt: $start, datetime_lt: $end }
				limit: 2
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				action
				datetime
				host: clientRequestHTTPHost
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### How to use

````mdx "graphql-api-explorer"
```graphql graphql-api-explorer title="A GraphQL query"
query ASingleDatasetExample($zoneTag: string, $start: Time, $end: Time) {
	viewer {
		zones(filter: { zoneTag: $zoneTag }) {
			firewallEventsAdaptive(
				filter: { datetime_gt: $start, datetime_lt: $end }
				limit: 2
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				action
				datetime
				host: clientRequestHTTPHost
			}
		}
	}
}
```
