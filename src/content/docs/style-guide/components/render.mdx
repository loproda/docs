import { Code, Details, Type, MetaInfo, PartialsUsage } from "~/components";

The `Render` component allows us to include a "partial", a reusable Markdown snippet, onto a page.

It also accepts parameters that can be used as variables within the partial, so that even content which needs slight differences between usages can be turned into a partial.

## Component

```mdx live
import { Render } from "~/components";

<Render
	file="simple-props"
	params={{
		name: "world",
	}}
/>
```

### Inputs

- `file` <Type text="string" />

  This should be the name of the partial, without the containing directory or file extension. For example, `/partials/style-guide/hello.mdx` would be `file="hello"`.

- `product` <Type text="string" /> <MetaInfo text="optional" />

  By default, it will look for partials in the same product folder as the current page. You can use this to specify a different product.

  :::caution

  When using the `Render` component inside partials, the original `product` is lost.

  For example, if there are three files:
  1.  `docs/fundamentals/index.mdx`
  2.  `partials/dns/thing.mdx`
  3.  `partials/dns/thing2.mdx`

  `docs/fundamentals/index.mdx` uses `<Render file="thing" product="dns" />`

  `partials/dns/thing.mdx` must use `<Render file="thing2" product="dns" />` as `product` cannot be inferred.

  :::

- `params` <Type text="object" /> <MetaInfo text="optional" />

  If you wish to substitute values inside your partial, you can use pass params which can be referenced in your partial. Refer to [properties](#properties).

## Properties

### Defining expected properties in frontmatter

Anything defined in the `params` property of the `Render` component is available inside the partial, using [JavaScript expressions](https://mdxjs.com/docs/using-mdx/).

To protect against required properties being missed, any partial that relies on `params` should also define `params` in the partial's frontmatter. This should be an array of strings, matching the property names you expect. If a property is optional, such as for [conditional content](#properties-to-render-content-conditionally), add a `?` to the end of the name.

```mdx
---
params:
  - product
  - deprecated?
---
```

:::caution
If you use the Markdown component to format your optional parameter, you need to craft it in a special way so you don't get an `Undefined` error in pages without the optional parameter.

Say, for example, that your optional parameter is `instructions`. You would craft it like this:

`{props.instructions && <Markdown text={props.instructions} />}`

instead of `<Markdown text={props.instructions} />`

:::

For each of the below examples, you can open the dropdown to view the partial's content.

### Properties as a plain string

The below example would render `Hello, world!`.

import simpleRaw from "~/content/partials/style-guide/simple-props.mdx?raw";

<Details header="simple-props.mdx">
	<Code code={simpleRaw} lang="mdx" />
</Details>

```mdx live
import { Render } from "~/components";

<Render file="simple-props" params={{ name: "world" }} />
```

### Properties in Markdown syntax

When using JavaScript expressions, you are now "inside JSX" and cannot use traditional Markdown syntax. Similarly, you cannot use a JavaScript expression inside Markdown syntax.

Ideally, you should not use Markdown syntax, such as `**strong**` or `[text](link)`, with properties. If using JSX is not feasible, there is a [`Markdown`](/style-guide/components/markdown/) component that will take a `text` property.

The [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/table-of-components/#components) includes a mapping of common Markdown syntax to their equivalent JSX elements.

#### Strong

import strongRaw from "~/content/partials/style-guide/strong-in-props.mdx?raw";

<Details header="strong-in-props.mdx">
	<Code code={strongRaw} lang="mdx" />
</Details>

```mdx live
import { Render } from "~/components";

<Render file="strong-in-props" params={{ do: "Text", dont: "**Text**" }} />
```

#### Links

import linkRaw from "~/content/partials/style-guide/link-in-props.mdx?raw";

<Details header="link-in-props.mdx">
	<Code code={linkRaw} lang="mdx" />
</Details>

```mdx live
import { Render } from "~/components";

<Render
	file="link-in-props"
	params={{
		link: "/style-guide/components/render/#links",
	}}
/>
```

#### Images

import imageRaw from "~/content/partials/style-guide/image-in-props.mdx?raw";

<Details header="image-in-props.mdx">
	<Code code={imageRaw} lang="mdx" />
</Details>

```mdx live
import { Render } from "~/components";

<Render file="image-in-props" params={{ image: "/logo.svg" }} />
```

#### Code blocks

import codeRaw from "~/content/partials/style-guide/code-in-props.mdx?raw";

<Details header="code-in-props.mdx">
	<Code code={codeRaw} lang="mdx" />
</Details>

```mdx live
import { Render } from "~/components";

<Render file="code-in-props" params={{ code: "export const foo = 'bar';" }} />
```

### Properties to render content conditionally

Anything that you can represent in a JavaScript expression can be used in your conditional logic.

This may be the [and (`&&`) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) or [ternary (`? ... : ... `) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator), the below example uses both.

import optionalRaw from "~/content/partials/style-guide/optional-props.mdx?raw";

<Details header="optional-props.mdx">
	<Code code={optionalRaw} lang="mdx" />
</Details>

```mdx live
import { Render } from "~/components";

<Render file="optional-props" params={{ product: "Thing", deprecated: true }} />

<hr />

<Render file="optional-props" params={{ product: "Thing Two" }} />

<hr />

<Render file="optional-props" params={{ product: "Thing Three" }} />
```

## Partials

<div class="md-ignore">
	<PartialsUsage />
</div>
