Hyperdrive supports MySQL and MySQL-compatible databases, [popular drivers](#supported-drivers), and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) libraries that use those drivers.

## Create a Hyperdrive

:::note

New to Hyperdrive? Refer to the [Get started guide](/hyperdrive/get-started/) to learn how to set up your first Hyperdrive.

:::

To create a Hyperdrive that connects to an existing MySQL database, use the [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) CLI or the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive).

When using Wrangler, replace the placeholder value provided to `--connection-string` with the connection string for your database:

```sh
# wrangler v3.11 and above required
npx wrangler hyperdrive create my-first-hyperdrive --connection-string="mysql://user:password@database.host.example.com:3306/databasenamehere"
```

The command above will output the ID of your Hyperdrive, which you will need to set in the [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for your Workers project:

<Render file="hyperdrive-node-compatibility-requirement" product="hyperdrive" />

This will allow Hyperdrive to generate a dynamic connection string within your Worker that you can pass to your existing database driver. Refer to [Driver examples](#driver-examples) to learn how to set up a database driver with Hyperdrive.

Refer to the [Examples documentation](/hyperdrive/examples/) for step-by-step guides on how to set up Hyperdrive with several popular database providers.

## Supported drivers

Hyperdrive uses Workers [TCP socket support](/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/#connect) to support TCP connections to databases. The following table lists the supported database drivers and the minimum version that works with Hyperdrive:

| Driver                   | Documentation                                                    | Minimum Version Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mysql2 (**recommended**) | [mysql2 documentation](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) | `mysql2@3.13.0`          | Supported in both Workers & Pages. Using the Promise API is recommended.                                                                                                                          |

Requires wrangler `3.78.7` or later. |
| Drizzle                  | [Drizzle documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/)               | Requires `mysql2@3.13.0` |                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Kysely                   | [Kysely documentation](https://kysely.dev/)                      | Requires `mysql2@3.13.0` |                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

^ _The marked libraries can use either mysql or mysql2 as a dependency._

Other drivers and ORMs not listed may also be supported: this list is not exhaustive.

### Database drivers and Node.js compatibility

[Node.js compatibility](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) is required for database drivers, including mysql and mysql2, and needs to be configured for your Workers project.

<Render file="nodejs_compat" product="workers" />

## Supported TLS (SSL) modes

Hyperdrive supports the following MySQL TLS/SSL connection modes when connecting to your origin database:

| Mode              | Supported                       | Details                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DISABLED`        | No                              | Hyperdrive does not support insecure plain text connections.                                                       |
| `PREFERRED`       | No (use `required`)             | Hyperdrive will always use TLS.                                                                                    |
| `REQUIRED`        | Yes (default)                   | TLS is required, and server certificates are validated (based on WebPKI).                                          |
| `VERIFY_CA`       | Not currently supported in beta | Verifies the server's TLS certificate is signed by a root CA on the client.                                        |
| `VERIFY_IDENTITY` | Not currently supported in beta | Identical to `VERIFY_CA`, but also requires that the database hostname matches the certificate's Common Name (CN). |

:::note

Hyperdrive does not currently support `VERIFY_CA` or `VERIFY_IDENTITY` for MySQL (beta).

## Driver examples

The following examples show you how to:

1. Create a database client with a database driver.
2. Pass the Hyperdrive connection string and connect to the database.
3. Query your database via Hyperdrive.

### `mysql2`

The following Workers code shows you how to use [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) with Hyperdrive using the Promise API.

<Render file="use-mysql2-to-make-query" product="hyperdrive" />

### `mysql`

The following Workers code shows you how to use [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) with Hyperdrive.

<Render file="use-mysql-to-make-query" product="hyperdrive" />

## Identify connections from Hyperdrive

To identify active connections to your MySQL database server from Hyperdrive:

- Hyperdrive's connections to your database will show up with `Cloudflare Hyperdrive` in the `PROGRAM_NAME` column in the `performance_schema.threads` table.
- Run `SELECT DISTINCT USER, HOST, PROGRAM_NAME FROM performance_schema.threads WHERE PROGRAM_NAME = 'Cloudflare Hyperdrive'` to show whether Hyperdrive is currently holding a connection (or connections) open to your database.

## Next steps
