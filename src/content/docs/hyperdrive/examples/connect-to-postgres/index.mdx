Hyperdrive supports PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL-compatible databases, [popular drivers](#supported-drivers) and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) libraries that use those drivers.

## Create a Hyperdrive

:::note

New to Hyperdrive? Refer to the [Get started guide](/hyperdrive/get-started/) to learn how to set up your first Hyperdrive.

:::

To create a Hyperdrive that connects to an existing PostgreSQL database, use the [wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) CLI or the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive).

When using wrangler, replace the placeholder value provided to `--connection-string` with the connection string for your database:

```sh
# wrangler v3.11 and above required
npx wrangler hyperdrive create my-first-hyperdrive --connection-string="postgres://user:password@database.host.example.com:5432/databasenamehere"
```

The command above will output the ID of your Hyperdrive, which you will need to set in the [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for your Workers project:

<Render file="hyperdrive-node-compatibility-requirement" product="hyperdrive" />

This will allow Hyperdrive to generate a dynamic connection string within your Worker that you can pass to your existing database driver. Refer to [Driver examples](#driver-examples) to learn how to set up a database driver with Hyperdrive.

Refer to the [Examples documentation](/hyperdrive/examples/) for step-by-step guides on how to set up Hyperdrive with several popular database providers.

## Supported drivers

Hyperdrive uses Workers [TCP socket support](/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/#connect) to support TCP connections to databases. The following table lists the supported database drivers and the minimum version that works with Hyperdrive:

^ _The marked libraries use `node-postgres` as a dependency._

Other drivers and ORMs not listed may also be supported: this list is not exhaustive.

### Database drivers and Node.js compatibility

[Node.js compatibility](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) is required for database drivers, including Postgres.js, and needs to be configured for your Workers project.

<Render file="nodejs_compat" product="workers" />

## Driver examples

The following examples show you how to:

1. Create a database client with a database driver.
2. Pass the Hyperdrive connection string and connect to the database.
3. Query your database via Hyperdrive.

### node-postgres / pg

<Render file="use-node-postgres-to-make-query" product="hyperdrive" />

### Postgres.js

The following Workers code shows you how to use [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) with Hyperdrive.

<Render file="use-postgres-js-to-make-query" product="hyperdrive" />

## Identify connections from Hyperdrive

To identify active connections to your Postgres database server from Hyperdrive:

- Hyperdrive's connections to your database will show up with `Cloudflare Hyperdrive` as the `application_name` in the `pg_stat_activity` table.
- Run `SELECT DISTINCT usename, application_name FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE application_name = 'Cloudflare Hyperdrive'` to show whether Hyperdrive is currently holding a connection (or connections) open to your database.

## Next steps

- Refer to the list of [supported database integrations](/workers/databases/connecting-to-databases/) to understand other ways to connect to existing databases.
- Learn more about how to use the [Socket API](/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets) in a Worker.
- Understand the [protocols supported by Workers](/workers/reference/protocols/).
