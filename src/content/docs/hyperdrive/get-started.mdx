Hyperdrive accelerates access to your existing databases from Cloudflare Workers, making even single-region databases feel globally distributed.

By maintaining a connection pool to your database within Cloudflare's network, Hyperdrive reduces seven round-trips to your database before you can even send a query: the TCP handshake (1x), TLS negotiation (3x), and database authentication (3x).

Hyperdrive understands the difference between read and write queries to your database, and caches the most common read queries, improving performance and reducing load on your origin database.

This guide will instruct you through:

- Creating your first Hyperdrive configuration.
- Creating a [Cloudflare Worker](/workers/) and binding it to your Hyperdrive configuration.
- Establishing a database connection from your Worker to a public database.

:::note

Hyperdrive currently works with PostgreSQL, MySQL and many compatible databases. This includes CockroachDB and Materialize (which are PostgreSQL-compatible), and Planetscale.

Learn more about the [databases that Hyperdrive supports](/hyperdrive/reference/supported-databases-and-features).

:::

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following:

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) if you have not already.
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Use a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.
3. Have **a publicly accessible** PostgreSQL/MySQL (or compatible) database.

## 1. Log in

Before creating your Hyperdrive binding, log in with your Cloudflare account by running:

```sh
npx wrangler login
```

You will be directed to a web page asking you to log in to the Cloudflare dashboard. After you have logged in, you will be asked if Wrangler can make changes to your Cloudflare account. Scroll down and select **Allow** to continue.

## 2. Create a Worker

:::note[New to Workers?]

Refer to [How Workers works](/workers/reference/how-workers-works/) to learn about the Workers serverless execution model works. Go to the [Workers Get started guide](/workers/get-started/guide/) to set up your first Worker.

:::

Create a new project named `hyperdrive-tutorial` by running:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"hyperdrive-tutorial"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "hello-world",
		type: "Worker only",
		lang: "TypeScript",
	}}
/>

This will create a new `hyperdrive-tutorial` directory. Your new `hyperdrive-tutorial` directory will include:

- A `"Hello World"` [Worker](/workers/get-started/guide/#3-write-code) at `src/index.ts`.
- A [`wrangler.jsonc`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file. `wrangler.jsonc` is how your `hyperdrive-tutorial` Worker will connect to Hyperdrive.

### Enable Node.js compatibility

[Node.js compatibility](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) is required for database drivers, and needs to be configured for your Workers project.

<Render file="nodejs_compat" product="workers" />

## 3. Connect Hyperdrive to a database

Hyperdrive works by connecting to your database, pooling database connections globally, and speeding up your database access through Cloudflare's network.

It will provide a secure connection string that is only accessible from your Worker which you can use to connect to your database through Hyperdrive.
This means that you can use the Hyperdrive connection string with your existing drivers or ORM libraries without needing significant changes to your code.

To create your first Hyperdrive database configuration, change into the directory you just created for your Workers project:

```sh
cd hyperdrive-tutorial
```

To create your first Hyperdrive, you will need:

- The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
- The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`).
- The password associated with that username.
- The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres` or `mysql`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="PostgreSQL">
		```txt

		postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name

    	```

    		Most database providers will provide a connection string you can copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

To create a Hyperdrive connection, run the `wrangler` command, replacing the placeholder values passed to the `--connection-string` flag with the values of your existing database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <YOUR_CONFIG_NAME> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="MySQL">
    	```txt

    	mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name

    	```

    		Most database providers will provide a connection string you can copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

    		To create a Hyperdrive connection, run the `wrangler` command, replacing the placeholder values passed to the `--connection-string` flag with the values of your existing database:

```sh
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <YOUR_CONFIG_NAME> --connection-string="mysql://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note[Manage caching]
By default, Hyperdrive will cache query results. If you wish to disable caching, pass the flag `--caching-disabled`.

Alternatively, you can use the `--max-age` flag to specify the maximum duration (in seconds) for which items should persist in the cache, before they are evicted. Default value is 60 seconds.

Refer to [Hyperdrive Wrangler commands](/hyperdrive/reference/wrangler-commands/) for more information.
:::

If successful, the command will output your new Hyperdrive configuration:

```json
{
	"hyperdrive": [
		{
			"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
			"id": "<example id: 57b7076f58be42419276f058a8968187>"
		}
	]
}
```

Copy the `id` field: you will use this in the next step to make Hyperdrive accessible from your Worker script.

:::note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

:::

## 4. Bind your Worker to Hyperdrive

<Render file="create-hyperdrive-binding" product="hyperdrive" />

## 5. Run a query against your database

Once you have created a Hyperdrive configuration and bound it to your Worker, you can run a query against your database.

### Install a database driver

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="PostgreSQL">

To connect to your database, you will need a database driver which allows you to authenticate and query your database. For this tutorial, you will use [node-postgres (pg)](https://node-postgres.com/), one of the most widely used PostgreSQL drivers.

To install `pg`, ensure you are in the `hyperdrive-tutorial` directory. Open your terminal and run the following command:

<PackageManagers pkg="pg" comment="This should install v8.13.0 or later" />

If you are using TypeScript, you should also install the type definitions for `pg`:

<PackageManagers pkg="@types/pg" dev comment="This should install v8.13.0 or later" />

With the driver installed, you can now create a Worker script that queries your database.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="MySQL">

To connect to your database, you will need a database driver which allows you to authenticate and query your database. For this tutorial, you will use [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2), one of the most widely used MySQL drivers.

To install `mysql2`, ensure you are in the `hyperdrive-tutorial` directory. Open your terminal and run the following command:

<PackageManagers pkg="mysql2" comment="This should install v3.13.0 or later" />

With the driver installed, you can now create a Worker script that queries your database.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Write a Worker

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="PostgreSQL">
After you have set up your database, you will run a SQL query from within your Worker.

Go to your `hyperdrive-tutorial` Worker and open the `index.ts` file.

The `index.ts` file is where you configure your Worker's interactions with Hyperdrive.

Populate your `index.ts` file with the following code:

```typescript
// pg 8.13.0 or later is recommended
import { Client } from "pg";

export interface Env {
	// If you set another name in the Wrangler config file as the value for 'binding',
	// replace "HYPERDRIVE" with the variable name you defined.
	HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		// Create a client using the pg driver (or any supported driver, ORM or query builder)
    // with the Hyperdrive credentials. These credentials are only accessible from your Worker.
    const sql = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });

		try {
			// Connect to the database
			await sql.connect();
			
			// Sample query
			const results = await sql.query(`SELECT * FROM pg_tables`);

			// Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
			ctx.waitUntil(sql.end());

			// Return result rows as JSON
			return Response.json(results.rows);
		} catch (e) {
			console.error(e);
			return Response.json(
				{ error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : e },
				{ status: 500 },
			);
		}
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Upon receiving a request, the code above does the following:

1. Creates a new database client configured to connect to your database via Hyperdrive, using the Hyperdrive connection string.
2. Initiates a query via `await sql.query()` that outputs all tables (user and system created) in the database (as an example query).
3. Returns the response as JSON to the client.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="MySQL">
After you have set up your database, you will run a SQL query from within your Worker.

Go to your `hyperdrive-tutorial` Worker and open the `index.ts` file.

The `index.ts` file is where you configure your Worker's interactions with Hyperdrive.

Populate your `index.ts` file with the following code:

```typescript
// mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
import { createConnection  } from 'mysql2/promise';

export interface Env {
  // If you set another name in the Wrangler config file as the value for 'binding',
  // replace "HYPERDRIVE" with the variable name you defined.
  HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
}

export default {
 async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {

		// Create a connection using the mysql2 driver (or any support driver, ORM or query builder)
		// with the Hyperdrive credentials. These credentials are only accessible from your Worker.
		const connection = await createConnection({
			host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
			user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
			password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
			database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
			port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port

			// The following line is needed for mysql2 compatibility with Workers
			// mysql2 uses eval() to optimize result parsing for rows with > 100 columns
			// Configure mysql2 to use static parsing instead of eval() parsing with disableEval
			disableEval: true
		});

		try{
			// Sample query
			const [results, fields] = await connection.query(
				'SHOW tables;'
			);

			// Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
			ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());

			// Return result rows as JSON
			return new Response(JSON.stringify({ results, fields }), {
				headers: {
					'Content-Type': 'application/json',
					'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
				},
			});
		}
		catch(e){
			console.error(e);
			return Response.json(
				{ error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : e },
				{ status: 500 },
			);
		}

 },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

```

## 6. Deploy your Worker

You can now deploy your Worker to make your project accessible on the Internet. To deploy your Worker, run:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
# Outputs: https://hyperdrive-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
```

You can now visit the URL for your newly created project to query your live database.

For example, if the URL of your new Worker is `hyperdrive-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`, accessing `https://hyperdrive-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/` will send a request to your Worker that queries your database directly.

By finishing this tutorial, you have created a Hyperdrive configuration, a Worker to access that database and deployed your project globally.
