Cloudflare automatically attaches headers to every [REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) request made through Browser Rendering. These headers make it easy for destination servers to identify that these requests came from Cloudflare.

:::note[Note]

These headers are meant to ensure transparency and cannot be removed or overridden (with `setExtraHTTPHeaders`, for example).

:::

| Header               | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cf-brapi-request-id` | A unique identifier for the Browser Rendering request when using the [REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/)                           |
| `cf-biso-request-id` | A unique identifier for the Browser Rendering request when using [Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/)             |
| `cf-biso-devtools`   | A flag indicating the request originated from Cloudflare's rendering infrastructure |
| `Signature-agent`    | [The location of the bot public keys](https://web-bot-auth.cloudflare-browser-rendering-085.workers.dev), used to sign the request and verify it came from Cloudflare                                       |
| `Signature` and `Signature-input`| A digital signature, used to validate requests, as shown in [this architecture document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-meunier-web-bot-auth-architecture)                     |

The `Signature` headers use an authentication method called [Web Bot Auth](/bots/concepts/bot/verified-bots/web-bot-auth/). Web Bot Auth leverages cryptographic signatures in HTTP messages to verify that a request comes from an automated bot. To verify a request originated from Cloudflare Browser Rendering, use the keys found on [this directory](https://web-bot-auth.cloudflare-browser-rendering-085.workers.dev/.well-known/http-message-signatures-directory) to verify the `Signature` and `Signature-Input` found in the headers from the incoming request. A successful verification proves that the request originated from Cloudflare Browser Rendering and has not been tampered with in transit.
