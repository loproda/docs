<Description>

Browser automation for [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/) and [quick browser actions](/browser-rendering/rest-api/).

</Description>

<Plan type="workers-all" />

Browser Rendering enables developers to programmatically control and interact with headless browser instances running on Cloudflareâ€™s global network. This facilitates tasks such as automating browser interactions, capturing screenshots, generating PDFs, and extracting data from web pages.

## Integration Methods

You can integrate Browser Rendering into your applications using one of the following methods:

- **[REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/)**: Ideal for simple, stateless tasks like capturing screenshots, generating PDFs, extracting HTML content, and more.
- **[Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/)**: Suitable for advanced browser automation within [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). This method provides greater control, enabling more complex workflows and persistent sessions.

Choose the method that best fits your use case. For example, use the [REST API endpoints](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) for straightforward tasks from external applications and use [Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/) for complex automation within the Cloudflare ecosystem.

## Use Cases

Browser Rendering can be utilized for various purposes, including:

- Fetch HTML content of a page.
- Capture screenshot of a webpage.
- Convert a webpage into a PDF document.
- Take a webpage snapshot.
- Scrape specified HTML elements from a webpage.
- Retrieve data in a structured format.
- Extract Markdown content from a webpage.
- Gather all hyperlinks found on a webpage.
