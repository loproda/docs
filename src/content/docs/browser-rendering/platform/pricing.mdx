Browser Rendering is currently available at no cost up to the [limits](/browser-rendering/platform/limits/) specified, with billing beginning on August 20, 2025.

There are two ways to use Browser Rendering. Depending on the method you use, here is how billing works:
- [**REST API**](/browser-rendering/rest-api/): Charged for **Duration** only ($/browser hour)
- [**Workers Bindings**](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/): Charged for both **Duration** and **Concurrency** ($/browser hour and # of concurrent browsers)

| Plan           | Included duration                                                                 | Included concurrency                                                 | Price (beyond included) |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Workers Free** | 10 minutes per day | 3 concurrent browsers | N/A |
| **Workers Paid** | 10 hours per month | 10 concurrent browsers (averaged monthly) | **1. REST API**: $0.09 per additional browser hour <br />**2. Workers Bindings**: $0.09 per additional browser hour <br /> $2.00 per additional concurrent browser |

<Details header="Where can I monitor my usage?">
You can monitor your Browser Rendering usage in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com). Go to **Compute (Workers)** > **Browser Rendering**.

<Details header="How is the number of concurrent browsers calculated?">
Cloudflare calculates concurrent browsers as the **monthly average of your daily peak usage**. In other words, we record **the peak number of concurrent browsers each day** and then average those values over the month. This approach reflects your typical traffic and ensures you are not disproportionately charged for brief spikes in browser concurrency.

### Examples of Workers Paid pricing
<br/>
#### Example: REST API pricing
If a Workers Paid user uses the REST API for 50 hours during the month, the estimated cost for the month is as follows.

For **browser duration**:
<br/>50 hours - 10 hours (included in plan) = 40 hours
<br/>40 hours × $0.09 per hour = $3.60

#### Example: Workers Bindings pricing
If a Workers paid user uses the Workers Bindings method for 50 hours during the month, and uses 10 concurrent browsers for the first 15 days and 20 concurrent browsers the last 15 days, the estimated cost for the month is as follows.

For **browser duration**:
<br/>50 hours - 10 hours (included in plan) = 40 hours
<br/>40 hours × $0.09 per hour = $3.60

For **concurrent browsers**:
<br/>((10 browsers × 15 days) + (20 browsers × 15 days)) = 450 total browsers used in month
<br />450 browsers used in month ÷ 30 days in month = 15 browsers (averaged monthly)
<br/>15 browsers (averaged monthly) − 10 (included in plan) = 5 browsers
<br/>5 browsers × $2.00 per browser = $10.00

For **browser duration** and **concurrent browsers**:
<br/>$3.60 + $10.00 = $13.60
