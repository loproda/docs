import { Render, Plan } from "~/components";

<Plan type="workers-all" />

## Workers Free

Users on the [Workers Free plan](/workers/platform/pricing/) are limited to **10 minutes of browser rendering usage per day**.

To increase this limit, you will need to [upgrade to a Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing).

| Feature                                | Limit           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Concurrent browsers per account (Workers Bindings only)        | 3 per account   |
| New browser instances per minute (Workers Bindings only)      | 3 per minute    |
| Browser timeout                        | 60 seconds |
| Total requests per min (REST API only) | 6 per minute    |

:::note[Note on browser timeout]
By default, a browser will time out if it does not get any [devtools](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) command for 60 seconds, freeing one instance. Users can optionally increase this by using the [`keep_alive` option](/browser-rendering/platform/puppeteer/#keep-alive). `browser.close()` releases the browser instance.

## Workers Paid

:::note[Higher limit requests]
The limits for Browser Rendering will continue to be raised over time. In the meantime, Cloudflare will grant [requests for higher limits](https://forms.gle/CdueDKvb26mTaepa9) on a case-by-case basis if a need for a higher limit can be clearly demonstrated.

## Note on concurrency

While the limits above define the maximum number of concurrent browser sessions per account, in practice you may not need to hit these limits. Browser sessions close automatically—by default, after 60 seconds of inactivity or upon task completion—so if each session finishes its work before a new request comes in, the effective concurrency is lower. This means that most workflows do not require very high concurrent browser limits.
