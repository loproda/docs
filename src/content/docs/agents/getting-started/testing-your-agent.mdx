Because Agents run on Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects, they can be tested using the same tools and techniques as Workers and Durable Objects.

## Writing and running tests

### Setup

:::note

The `agents-starter` template and new Cloudflare Workers projects already include the relevant `vitest` and `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` packages, as well as a valid `vitest.config.js` file.

:::

Before you write your first test, install the necessary packages:

```sh
npm install vitest@~3.0.0 --save-dev --save-exact
npm install @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers --save-dev
```

Ensure that your `vitest.config.js` file is identical to the following:

```js
import { defineWorkersConfig } from "@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/config";

export default defineWorkersConfig({
	test: {
		poolOptions: {
			workers: {
				wrangler: { configPath: "./wrangler.toml" },
			},
		},
	},
});
```

### Add the Agent configuration

Add a `durableObjects` configuration to `vitest.config.js` with the name of your Agent class:

```js
import { defineWorkersConfig } from "@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/config";

export default defineWorkersConfig({
	test: {
		poolOptions: {
			workers: {
				main: "./src/index.ts",
				miniflare: {
					durableObjects: {
						NAME: "MyAgent",
					},
				},
			},
		},
	},
});
```

### Write a test

:::note

Review the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/) for more information on testing, including the test API reference and advanced testing techniques.

:::

Tests use the `vitest` framework. A basic test suite for your Agent can validate how your Agent responds to requests, but can also unit test your Agent's methods and state.

```ts
import {
	env,
	createExecutionContext,
	waitOnExecutionContext,
	SELF,
} from "cloudflare:test";
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import worker from "../src";
import { Env } from "../src";

interface ProvidedEnv extends Env {}

describe("make a request to my Agent", () => {
	// Unit testing approach
	it("responds with state", async () => {
		// Provide a valid URL that your Worker can use to route to your Agent
		// If you are using routeAgentRequest, this will be /agent/:agent/:name
		const request = new Request<unknown, IncomingRequestCfProperties>(
			"http://example.com/agent/my-agent/agent-123",
		);
		const ctx = createExecutionContext();
		const response = await worker.fetch(request, env, ctx);
		await waitOnExecutionContext(ctx);
		expect(await response.text()).toMatchObject({ hello: "from your agent" });
	});

	it("also responds with state", async () => {
		const request = new Request("http://example.com/agent/my-agent/agent-123");
		const response = await SELF.fetch(request);
		expect(await response.text()).toMatchObject({ hello: "from your agent" });
	});
});
```

### Run tests

Running tests is done using the `vitest` CLI:

```sh
$ npm run test
# or run vitest directly
$ npx vitest
```

```sh output
  MyAgent
    âœ“ should return a greeting (1 ms)

Test Files  1 passed (1)
```

Review the [documentation on testing](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/write-your-first-test/) for additional examples and test configuration.

## Running Agents locally

You can also run an Agent locally using the `wrangler` CLI:

```sh
$ npx wrangler dev
```

```sh output
Your Worker and resources are simulated locally via Miniflare. For more information, see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/local-development.

Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- Durable Objects:
  - MyAgent: MyAgent
  Starting local server...
[wrangler:inf] Ready on http://localhost:53645
```

This spins up a local development server that runs the same runtime as Cloudflare Workers, and allows you to iterate on your Agent's code and test it locally without deploying it.

Visit the [`wrangler dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) docs to review the CLI flags and configuration options.
