import { MetaInfo, Render, Type, WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

An Agent is configured like any other Cloudflare Workers project, and uses [a wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) file to define where your code is and what services (bindings) it will use.

### Project structure

The typical file structure for an Agent project created from `npm create cloudflare@latest agents-starter -- --template cloudflare/agents-starter` follows:

```sh
.
|-- package-lock.json
|-- package.json
|-- public
|   `-- index.html
|-- src
|   `-- index.ts // your Agent definition
|-- test
|   |-- index.spec.ts // your tests
|   `-- tsconfig.json
|-- tsconfig.json
|-- vitest.config.mts
|-- worker-configuration.d.ts
`-- wrangler.jsonc // your Workers & Agent configuration
```

### Example configuration

Below is a minimal `wrangler.jsonc` file that defines the configuration for an Agent, including the entry point, `durable_object` namespace, and code `migrations`:

<WranglerConfig>

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "agents-example",
	"main": "src/index.ts",
	"compatibility_date": "2025-02-23",
	"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
	"durable_objects": {
		"bindings": [
			{
				// Required:
				"name": "MyAgent", // How your Agent is called from your Worker
				"class_name": "MyAgent", // Must match the class name of the Agent in your code
				// Optional: set this if the Agent is defined in another Worker script
				"script_name": "the-other-worker"
			},
		],
	},
	"migrations": [
		{
			"tag": "v1",
			// Mandatory for the Agent to store state
			"new_sqlite_classes": ["MyAgent"],
		},
	],
	"observability": {
		"enabled": true,
	},
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

The configuration includes:

- A `main` field that points to the entry point of your Agent, which is typically a TypeScript (or JavaScript) file.
- A `durable_objects` field that defines the [Durable Object namespace](/durable-objects/reference/glossary/) that your Agents will run within.
- A `migrations` field that defines the code migrations that your Agent will use. This field is mandatory and must contain at least one migration. The `new_sqlite_classes` field is mandatory for the Agent to store state.

Agents must define these fields in their `wrangler.jsonc` (or `wrangler.toml`) config file.
