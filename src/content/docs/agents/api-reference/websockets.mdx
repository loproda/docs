Users and clients can connect to an Agent directly over WebSockets, allowing long-running, bi-directional communication with your Agent as it operates.

To enable an Agent to accept WebSockets, define `onConnect` and `onMessage` methods on your Agent.

* `onConnect(connection: Connection, ctx: ConnectionContext)` is called when a client establishes a new WebSocket connection. The original HTTP request, including request headers, cookies, and the URL itself, are available on `ctx.request`.
* `onMessage(connection: Connection, message: WSMessage)` is called for each incoming WebSocket message. Messages are one of `ArrayBuffer | ArrayBufferView | string`, and you can send messages back to a client using `connection.send()`. You can distinguish between client connections by checking `connection.id`, which is unique for each connected client.

Here's an example of an Agent that echoes back any message it receives:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
import { Agent, Connection } from "agents";

export class ChatAgent extends Agent {
	async onConnect(connection: Connection, ctx: ConnectionContext) {
  	// Connections are automatically accepted by the SDK.
    // You can also explicitly close a connection here with connection.close()
    // Access the Request on ctx.request to inspect headers, cookies and the URL
  }

  async onMessage(connection: Connection, message: WSMessage) {
    // const response = await longRunningAITask(message)
    await connection.send(message)
  }
}
```

</TypeScriptExample>

### Connecting clients

The Agent framework includes a useful helper package for connecting directly to your Agent (or other Agents) from a client application. Import `agents/client`, create an instance of `AgentClient` and use it to connect to an instance of your Agent:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
import { AgentClient } from "agents/client";

const connection = new AgentClient({
  agent: "dialogue-agent",
  name: "insight-seeker",
});

connection.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  console.log("Received:", event.data);
});

connection.send(
  JSON.stringify({
    type: "inquiry",
    content: "What patterns do you see?",
  })
);
```

</TypeScriptExample>

### React clients

React-based applications can import `agents/react` and use the `useAgent` hook to connect to an instance of an Agent directly:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
import { useAgent } from "agents/react";

function AgentInterface() {
  const connection = useAgent({
    agent: "dialogue-agent",
    name: "insight-seeker",
    onMessage: (message) => {
      console.log("Understanding received:", message.data);
    },
    onOpen: () => console.log("Connection established"),
    onClose: () => console.log("Connection closed"),
  });

  const inquire = () => {
    connection.send(
      JSON.stringify({
        type: "inquiry",
        content: "What insights have you gathered?",
      })
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className="agent-interface">
      <button onClick={inquire}>Seek Understanding</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```
</TypeScriptExample>

The `useAgent` hook automatically handles the lifecycle of the connection, ensuring that it is properly initialized and cleaned up when the component mounts and unmounts. You can also [combine `useAgent` with `useState`](/agents/api-reference/store-and-sync-state/) to automatically synchronize state across all clients connected to your Agent.

### Handling WebSocket events

Define `onError` and `onClose` methods on your Agent to explicitly handle WebSocket client errors and close events. Log errors, clean up state, and/or emit metrics:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
import { Agent, Connection } from "agents";

export class ChatAgent extends Agent {
 	// onConnect and onMessage methods
  // ...

  // WebSocket error and disconnection (close) handling.
  async onError(connection: Connection, error: unknown): Promise<void> {
		console.error(`WS error: ${error}`);
	}
	async onClose(connection: Connection, code: number, reason: string, wasClean: boolean): Promise<void> {
		console.log(`WS closed: ${code} - ${reason} - wasClean: ${wasClean}`);
		connection.close();
	}
}

```

</TypeScriptExample>
