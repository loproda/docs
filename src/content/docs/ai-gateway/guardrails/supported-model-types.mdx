AI Gateway's Guardrails detects the type of AI model being used and applies safety checks accordingly:

- **Text generation models**: Both prompts and responses are evaluated.
- **Embedding models**: Only the prompt is evaluated, as the response consists of numerical embeddings, which are not meaningful for moderation.
- **Unknown models**: If the model type cannot be determined, only the prompt is evaluated, while the response bypass Guardrails.

:::note[Note]

Guardrails does not yet support streaming responses. Support for streaming is planned for a future update.
