Guardrails help you deploy AI applications safely by intercepting and evaluating both user prompts and model responses for harmful content. Acting as a proxy between your application and [model providers](/ai-gateway/providers/) (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and others), AI Gateway's Guardrails ensure a consistent and secure experience across your entire AI ecosystem.

Guardrails proactively monitor interactions between users and AI models, giving you:

- **Consistent moderation**: Uniform moderation layer that works across models and providers.
- **Enhanced safety and user trust**: Proactively protect users from harmful or inappropriate interactions.
- **Flexibility and control over allowed content**: Specify which categories to monitor and choose between flagging or outright blocking.
- **Auditing and compliance capabilities**: Receive updates on evolving regulatory requirements with logs of user prompts, model responses, and enforced guardrails.

## How Guardrails work

AI Gateway inspects all interactions in real time by evaluating content against predefined safety parameters. Guardrails work by:

1. Intercepting interactions:
   AI Gateway proxies requests and responses, sitting between the user and the AI model.

2. Inspecting content:

   - User prompts: AI Gateway checks prompts against safety parameters (for example, violence, hate, or sexual content). Based on your settings, prompts can be flagged or blocked before reaching the model.
   - Model responses: Once processed, the AI model response is inspected. If hazardous content is detected, it can be flagged or blocked before being delivered to the user.

3. Applying actions:
   Depending on your configuration, flagged content is logged for review, while blocked content is prevented from proceeding.
