## Background

An `EmailEvent` is the event type to programmatically process your emails with a Worker. You can reject, forward, or drop emails according to the logic you construct in your Worker.

***

## Syntax: ES modules

`EmailEvent` can be handled in Workers functions written using the [ES modules format](/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/) by adding an `email` function to your module's exported handlers:

```js
export default {
  async email(message, env, ctx) {
    await message.forward("<YOUR_EMAIL>");
  },
};
```

### Parameters



* `message` ForwardableEmailMessage

  * A [`ForwardableEmailMessage` object](#forwardableemailmessage-definition).

* `env` object

  * An object containing the bindings associated with your Worker using ES modules format, such as KV namespaces and Durable Objects.

* `ctx` object
  * An object containing the context associated with your Worker using ES modules format. Currently, this object just contains the `waitUntil` function.



***

## Syntax: Service Worker

:::caution[Service Workers are deprecated]

Service Workers are deprecated but still supported. We recommend using [Module Workers](/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/) instead. New features may not be supported for Service Workers.

:::

`EmailEvent` can be handled in Workers functions written using the Service Worker syntax by attaching to the `email` event with `addEventListener`:

```js
addEventListener("email", async (event) => {
  await event.message.forward("<YOUR_EMAIL>");
});
```

### Properties



* `event.message` ForwardableEmailMessage

  * An [`ForwardableEmailMessage` object](#forwardableemailmessage-definition).



***

## `ForwardableEmailMessage` definition

```ts
 interface ForwardableEmailMessage<Body = unknown> {
  readonly from: string;
  readonly to: string;
  readonly headers: Headers;
  readonly raw: ReadableStream;
  readonly rawSize: number;

  public constructor(from: string, to: string, raw: ReadableStream | string);

  setReject(reason: string): void;
  forward(rcptTo: string, headers?: Headers): Promise<void>;
  reply(message: EmailMessage): Promise<void>;
}
```

An email message that is sent to a consumer Worker and can be rejected/forwarded.

* `from` string

  * `Envelope From` attribute of the email message.

* `to` string

  * `Envelope To` attribute of the email message.

* `headers` Headers

  * A [`Headers` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers).

* `raw` ReadableStream

  * [Stream](/workers/runtime-apis/streams/readablestream) of the email message content.

* `rawSize` number

  * Size of the email message content.

* <code>setReject(reasonstring)</code> : void

  * Reject this email message by returning a permanent SMTP error back to the connecting client, including the given reason.

* <code>forward(rcptTostring, headersHeadersoptional)</code> : Promise

  * Forward this email message to a verified destination address of the account. If you want, you can add extra headers to the email message. Only `X-*` headers are allowed.
  * When the promise resolves, the message is confirmed to be forwarded to a verified destination address.

* <code>reply(EmailMessage)</code> : Promise

  * Reply to the sender of this email message with a new EmailMessage object.
  * When the promise resolves, the message is confirmed to be replied.
