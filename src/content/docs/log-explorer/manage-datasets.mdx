Log Explorer allows you to enable or disable which datasets are available to query in Log Search.

## Supported datasets

Log Explorer currently supports the following datasets:

- [HTTP requests](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/http_requests/) (`FROM http_requests`)
- [Firewall events](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/firewall_events/) (`FROM firewall_events`)
- [Access](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/)
- [CASB](/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/)
- [Secure Web Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/)
- [WARP](/warp-client/)

## Enable Log Explorer

In order for Log Explorer to begin storing logs, you need to enable the desired datasets. You can do this via the dashboard or the API.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account.
2. Go to **Log Explorer** > **Manage datasets**.
3. Select **Add dataset** to select the datasets you want to query. 
4. Choose a dataset and then a zone. Then, select **Add**. You can always return to this page to enable more datasets or manage your existing ones.

:::note
It may take a few minutes for the logs to become available for querying.
:::

If you are using the API, Use the Log Explorer API to enable Log Explorer for each dataset you wish to store. It may take a few minutes after a log stream is enabled before you can view the logs.

The following `curl` command is an example for enabling the zone-level dataset `http_requests`, as well as the expected response when the command succeeds.

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/logs/explorer/datasets \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--json '{
  "dataset": "http_requests"
}'
```

```json output
{
  "result": {
    "dataset": "http_requests",
    "object_type": "zone",
    "object_id": "<ZONE ID>",
    "created_at": "2025-06-03T14:33:16Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-06-03T14:33:16Z",
    "dataset_id": "01973635f7e273a1964a02f4d4502499",
    "enabled": true
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

To enable an account-level dataset, replace `zones/{zone_id}` with `accounts/{account_id}` in the `curl` command. For example:

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/logs/explorer/datasets \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--json '{
  "dataset": "access_requests"
}'
```
