Internal DNS leverages [Gateway analytics](/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/gateway/). Below you can find information about specific fields and different methods you can use to access this data.

## GraphQL

For detailed metrics, use the [GraphQL API](/analytics/graphql-api/). Refer to the GraphQL Analytics API documentation for guidance on how to [get started](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/).

The [fields](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/querying-basics/) added to cover Internal DNS are the following:

- `InternalDNSFallbackStrategy`: The fallback strategy applied to the internal DNS response. Empty if no fallback strategy was applied.
- `InternalDNSRCode`: The response code sent back by the internal DNS service.
- `InternalDNSViewID`: The view identifier that was sent to the internal DNS service.
- `InternalDNSZoneID`: The internal zone identifier returned by the internal DNS service.

## Logs

Leverage Logpush jobs for [Gateway DNS](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/gateway_dns/#internaldnsfallbackstrategy). For help setting up Logpush, refer to [Logpush](/logs/logpush/) documentation.

You can also set up [Logpush filters](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/filters/) to only push logs related to a specific [internal zone](/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/) or [view](/dns/internal-dns/dns-views/) ID.
