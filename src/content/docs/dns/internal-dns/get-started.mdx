Follow this guide to get started with Internal DNS.

## Before you begin

<Render file="internal-dns-beta-note" />

- Make sure you have an Enterprise account with access to [Gateway resolver policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/resolver-policies/) and [Internal DNS](/dns/internal-dns/).
- Consider the different ways in which you can [connect to Gateway resolver](/dns/internal-dns/connectivity/).
- If you will be using an API token for authentication, make sure you have the following permissions:

<Details header="API token configuration">
<Example>
**Permissions**
- *Account* - *DNS Views* - *Edit*
- *Zone* - *DNS* - *Edit*
- *Account* - *Account Settings* - *Edit*
- *Zone* - *DNS Settings* - *Edit*
- *Zone* - *Zone* - *Edit*

**Account Resources**
- *Include* - *(Your account)*

**Zone Resources**
- *Include* - *All zones*

</ Example>
</ Details>


## 1. Set up your internal DNS zone

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render file="internal-zone-create-dash" params={{
	conditional: "get-started-detail"}}
/>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="internal-zone-create-api" params={{
	conditional: "get-started-detail"}}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### (Optional) Reference a zone from another zone

<Render file="internal-reference-zone-intro" params={{
	conditional: "get-started-link"}}
/>

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Go to **Internal DNS** and select a zone.
2. Within the selected zone, go to **Reference zone**.
3. Select **Add reference zone**.
4. Find the zone you want to use as reference and choose **Select** in the respective row.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

1. Use the [Update DNS settings](/api/resources/dns/subresources/settings/subresources/zone/methods/edit/) endpoint to add a reference from an internal zone to another internal zone. In `--json`, specify the `internal_dns` object with the parameter `reference_zone_id`.

<Example>
<Render file="internal-reference-zone-api"/>
</ Example>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 2. Link your internal zone to a view

Since the resolver policy will require a [DNS view](/dns/internal-dns/dns-views/), you must have at least one view to be able to route requests to internal zones.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render file="internal-dns-view-create-dash" params={{
	conditional: "get-started-detail"}}
/>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

1. Use the [Create Internal DNS View](/api/resources/dns/subresources/settings/subresources/account/subresources/views/methods/create/) endpoint. For each view you create, list all the internal zones that should be grouped under that view.

<Details header="DNS view configuration conditions">
<Render file="internal-dns-view-conditions" />
</Details>

</TabItem> </Tabs>


## 3. Configure Gateway policies

:::note
The Gateway configuration must exist within the same Cloudflare account where the internal zone exists.
:::

Besides selecting an internal DNS view when setting up your resolver policies, you can also enable the **fallback through public DNS** option.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Resolver policies**.
2. Select **Add a policy** and enter a name and description.
3. Create an expression for the traffic you wish to route. For guidance about selectors, operators, and values, refer to [Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/resolver-policies/#selectors).
4. Select **Use Internal DNS**. Choose the view that queries matching the expression should be sent to.
5. (Optional) Adjust the option to **fallback through public DNS** according to your use case.
- Off: Gateway DNS resolver returns the response as-is to the client.
- On: In case the response from the internal zone is REFUSED, NXDOMAIN, or a response with a CNAME type, Gateway DNS resolver sends the query to Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 public resolver and tries to resolve the query via public DNS.
6. Select **Create policy** to confirm.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Use the API endpoints under [Zero Trust > Gateway > Rules](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/rules/) to set up resolver policies. For guidance about selectors, operators, and values, refer to [Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/resolver-policies/#selectors).

Use the rule settings object to define `resolve_dns_internally`, specifying `view_id` and `fallback` option. The fallback options behave as follows:

- `none`: Gateway DNS resolver returns the response as-is to the client.
- `public_dns`: In case the response from the internal zone is REFUSED, NXDOMAIN, or a response with a CNAME type, Gateway DNS resolver sends the query to Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 public resolver and tries to resolve the query via public DNS.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

Once you add the Gateway resolver policy, it will be listed in the respective internal view under **Resolver policies referencing this view**.
