**Zone IDs and names on individual DNS records**

Records returned by the API will no longer contain the `zone_id` and `zone_name` fields. This change may take up to four weeks to fully roll out. The affected fields were deprecated with an End of Life (EOL) date of November 30, 2024.

**Quote validation for TXT records added via dashboard**

When creating [TXT records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#txt) via the dashboard you will now find:

* Field validation errors if double quotes `"` are added inconsistently.
* Automatically quoted TXT content upon save if no quotes exist in the record content field.

**API support for per-record CNAME flattening**

Paid zones now have the option to flatten specific CNAME records. When using the API, specify the setting `cname_flatten` as `true` or `false`. Refer to the [documentation](/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/#per-record) for details.
