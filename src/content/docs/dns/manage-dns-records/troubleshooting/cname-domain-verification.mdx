    content: Cannot verify a domain with CNAME

---

When configuring services from external providers - such as email services, for example - it is possible that they require you to verify your domain by placing a CNAME record at your zone.

Consider the following sections if this is not working correctly for you.

## Causes

You may find issues if you have one of the following:

* The CNAME record you created for domain verification is set to [**Proxied**](/dns/proxy-status/).
* The CNAME record is correctly set to DNS only (not proxied) but, in your [zone settings](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/settings), [**CNAME flattening for all CNAME records**](/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/#for-all-cname-records) is enabled.
* The CNAME record is correctly set to DNS only (not proxied) but CNAME flattening is [enabled for that record specifically](/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/#per-record).

## Solution

Make sure that:

* In your zone DNS settings: [**CNAME flattening for all CNAME records**](/dns/cname-flattening/) is disabled.
* On the DNS records table: you have filled in the CNAME record fields correctly, proxy status is set to **DNS only**, and **Flatten** is disabled.
