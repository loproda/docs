You might notice TXT records like `_acme-challenge.<hostname>` are returned by your domain but cannot be found on the DNS tab of your Cloudflare dashboard.

## Causes

These records are automatically created to allow Cloudflare edge certificates ([universal](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/), [advanced](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/), and [backup](/ssl/edge-certificates/backup-certificates/)) to be provisioned. `_acme-challenge` records are required by <GlossaryTooltip term="Certificate Authority (CA)">certificate authorities (CAs)</GlossaryTooltip> so that they can verify your domain ownership before issuing the SSL/TLS certificate. For details, refer to [Domain control validation (DCV)](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/).

## Solution

As these records are tied to the certificates, they cannot be deleted from the DNS tab of your Cloudflare dashboard.

If you need more `_acme-challenge.<hostname>` TXT records in order to provision certificates on your side, you can [manually add them](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) under [DNS records](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records).

If you want to remove these records:

 * [Disable Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/disable-universal-ssl/) to remove the records related to universal and backup certificates.
 * [Delete advanced certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/manage-certificates/#delete-a-certificate) to remove the records related to advanced certificates.
