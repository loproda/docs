Consider the sections below to learn how to access analytics and logs for your DNS Firewall.

## Analytics

### GraphQL

Use the [GraphQL API](/analytics/graphql-api/) to access DNS Firewall analytics. Refer to the GraphQL Analytics API documentation for guidance on how to [get started](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/).

The DNS Firewall analytics has two [schemas](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/querying-basics/):

* `dnsFirewallAnalyticsAdaptive`: Retrieve information about individual DNS Firewall queries.
* `dnsFirewallAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups`: Get reports on aggregate information only.

### Cloudflare API <Badge text="Legacy" variant="caution" size="medium" />

You can also use the DNS Firewall API [reports endpoint](/api/resources/dns_firewall/subresources/analytics/subresources/reports/).


## Logs

You can [set up Logpush](/logs/logpush/) to deliver [DNS Firewall logs](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/dns_firewall_logs/) to a storage service, SIEM, or log management provider.

### Response reasons

When analyzing why Cloudflare DNS Firewall responded in one way or another to a specific query, consider the `responseReason` log field.

The following table provides a description for each of the values that might be returned as a response reason:

| Value                     | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `success`                 | Response was successfully served, either from Cloudflare cache or forwarded from the upstream.                                                                 |
| `upstream_failure`        | Response could not be fetched from the upstream due to the upstream failing to respond.                                                                        |
| `upstream_servfail`       | Response could not be fetched from the upstream due to the upstream responding with `SERVFAIL`.                                                                |
| `invalid_query`           | Query is invalid and cannot be processed.                                                                                                                      |
| `any_type_blocked`        | Query of type `ANY` was blocked according to your [DNS Firewall settings](/dns/dns-firewall/setup/) ([RFC 8482](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8482.html)). |
| `rate_limit`              | Query was rate limited according to your [DNS Firewall settings](/dns/dns-firewall/setup/).                                                                    |
| `chaos_success`           | Response for [Chaos class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaosnet) was successfully served.                                                                    |
| `attack_mitigation_block` | Query was blocked as part of [random prefix attack mitigation](/dns/dns-firewall/random-prefix-attacks/).                                                      |
| `unknown`                 | There was an unknown error.                                                                                                                                    |
