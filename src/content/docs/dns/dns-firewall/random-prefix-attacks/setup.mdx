import { APIRequest } from "~/components";

In order to enable automatic mitigation of [random prefix attacks](/dns/dns-firewall/random-prefix-attacks/about/):

1. Set up [DNS Firewall](/dns/dns-firewall/setup/).
2. Send a [`PATCH` request](/api/resources/dns_firewall/methods/edit/) to update your DNS Firewall cluster.

   <APIRequest
   	path="/accounts/{account_id}/dns_firewall/{dns_firewall_id}"
   	method="PATCH"
   	json={{
      "attack_mitigation": {
        "enabled": true,
        "only_when_upstream_unhealthy": true,
      }
   	}}
   />

Once you receive a `200` success response from the API, queries identified as being part of a random prefix attack will receive a `REFUSED` response.

:::note


If you do not specify otherwise in your API call, Cloudflare automatically sets the `"only_when_upstream_unhealthy"` parameter to true, which means that Cloudflare will only mitigate attacks when we detect that the upstream is unresponsive (possibly as a result of an attack). This setting can also be changed via the API, using a request similar to the ones shown above.
