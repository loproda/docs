As explained in [our blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/black-lies/), Cloudflare's implementation of negative answers with NSEC is protected against zone walking[^1]. This implementation removes the need for NSEC3 and has been [proposed as an IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence/).

However, if you must use NSEC3 for compliance reasons, you can enable it as explained below.

## Enable NSEC3

Use the [Edit DNSSEC Status endpoint](/api/resources/dns/subresources/dnssec/methods/edit/), setting `status` to `active` and `dnssec_use_nsec3` to `true`. You should replace the values started by `$` with your zone ID and authentication credentials. To learn more about using the Cloudflare API, refer to [Fundamentals](/fundamentals/api/get-started/).

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/dnssec"
	method="PATCH"
	json={{
		"dnssec_use_nsec3": true,
		"status": "active"
	}}
/>

### Pre-signed DNSSEC

If you use Cloudflare as a secondary DNS provider with [pre-signed DNSSEC](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/dnssec-for-secondary/), setting `dnssec_use_nsec3` to `true` means that Cloudflare will use NSEC3 records as transferred in from your primary DNS provider.

Otherwise, NSEC3 records will be generated and signed at request time.

## Verify NSEC3 is in use

To validate that NSEC3 is being used, consider the following scenarios:

### Non-existent zone name

A command like the following would trigger a signed negative response using NSEC3 for proof of non-existence. Look for NSEC3 records under the `Authority Section` of the response.

```sh
dig +dnssec doesnotexist.example.com
```

### Non-existent record type at an existing name

If the name `www` exists but the type TXT does not, the example below would trigger a signed NODATA response using NSEC3. Look for NSEC3 records under the `Authority Section` of the response.

```sh
dig +dnssec www.example.com TXT
```

## Availability

NSEC3 is only available for zones on the Enterprise plan.

[^1]: A method where an attacker exploits NSEC negative answers to obtain all names in a given zone. This is possible when such negative answers provide information on the previous and next names in a chain.
