With [Foundation DNS](/dns/foundation-dns/), you can request that the ZSK/KSK pair that is used for [DNSSEC](/dns/dnssec/) is unique to your Cloudflare account. To opt in to this feature, contact your account team.

All zones within your Cloudflare account - regardless of using [standard](/dns/nameservers/#standard-nameservers) or [advanced nameservers](/dns/foundation-dns/advanced-nameservers/) - will use the dedicated Zone Signing Key (ZSK) and Key Signing Key (KSK) for DNSSEC. These keys are set at the account level.
