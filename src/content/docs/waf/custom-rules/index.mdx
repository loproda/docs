Custom rules are evaluated in order, and some actions like _Block_ will stop the evaluation of other rules. For more details on actions and their behavior, refer to the [actions reference](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/).

To define sets of custom rules that apply to more than one zone, use [custom rulesets](/waf/account/custom-rulesets/), which require an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.
