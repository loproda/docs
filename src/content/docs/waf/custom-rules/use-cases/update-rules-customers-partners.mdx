title: Update custom rules for customers or partners
---

You may want to adjust your custom rules to increase access by customers or partners.

Potential examples include:

- Removing rate limiting for an API
- Sharing brand assets and marketing materials

:::caution
The example custom rules in this page can bypass Cloudflare's security features and are generally not recommended. Use with caution.

## Use ASN in custom rules

If a customer or partner is large enough, you could set up a custom rule based on an [autonomous system number (ASN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/).

### Allow traffic by ASN

This example uses:

- The [`ip.src.asnum`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/ip.src.asnum/) field to specify the general region.
- The [`cf.bot_management.score`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.bot_management.score/) field to ensure partner traffic does not come from bots.

Example custom rule:

- **Expression**: `(ip.src.asnum eq 64496 and cf.bot_management.score gt 30)`
- **Action**: _Skip:_
  - _All remaining custom rules_

:::note
Access to [Bot Management](/bots/plans/bm-subscription/) requires a Cloudflare Enterprise plan with Bot Management.

### Adjust rules by ASN

This example custom rule uses:

- The [`ip.src.asnum`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/ip.src.asnum/) field to specify the general region.
- The [`cf.bot_management.score`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.bot_management.score/) field to check if the request comes from a human.

If a request meets these criteria, the custom rule will skip [User Agent Blocking](/waf/tools/user-agent-blocking/) rules.

- **Expression**: `(ip.src.asnum eq 64496 and cf.bot_management.score gt 50)`
- **Action**: _Skip:_
  - _User Agent Blocking_

## Use IP addresses in custom rules

For smaller organizations, you could set up custom rules based on IP addresses.

### Allow traffic by IP address

This example:

- Specifies the source IP address and the host.
- Uses the [`cf.bot_management.score`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.bot_management.score/) field to ensure requests are not high-risk traffic.

Example custom rule:

- **Expression**: `(ip.src eq 203.0.113.1 and http.host eq "example.com" and cf.bot_management.score gt 30)`
- **Action**: _Skip:_
  - _All remaining custom rules_

### Adjust rules by IP address

This example custom rule specifies the source IP address and the host.

If a request meets these criteria, the custom rule will skip [rate limiting rules](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/).

- **Expression**: `(ip.src eq 203.0.113.1 and http.host eq "example.com")`
- **Action**: _Skip:_
  - _All remaining custom rules_
