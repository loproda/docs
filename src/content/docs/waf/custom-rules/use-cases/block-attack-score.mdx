import { GlossaryDefinition } from "~/components";

The [attack score](/waf/detections/attack-score/) helps identify variations of known attacks and their malicious payloads.

This example custom rule blocks requests based on country code ([ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) format), from requests with an attack score lower than 20. For more information, refer to [WAF attack score](/waf/detections/attack-score/).

- **Expression**: `(ip.src.country in {"CN" "TW" "US" "GB"} and cf.waf.score lt 20)`
- **Action**: _Block_
