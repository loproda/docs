The [Lists API](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/) provides an interface for programmatically managing the following types of lists:

- [Custom lists](/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/): Contain one or more strings of the same type (such as IP addresses or hostnames) that you can reference collectively, by name, in rule expressions.

- [Bulk Redirect Lists](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/concepts/#bulk-redirect-lists): Contain URL redirects that you enable by creating a Bulk Redirect Rule.

To use a list in a rule expression, refer to [Values: Lists](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/values/#lists) in the Rules language documentation.

## Get started

To get started, review the Lists [JSON object](/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/json-object/) and [Endpoints](/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/endpoints/).

## Rate limiting for Lists API requests

Cloudflare may apply rate limiting to your API requests creating, modifying, or deleting list items in custom lists and Bulk Redirect Lists.

Each operation (create, edit, or delete) on a list item counts as a modification. The following limits apply:

- You can make a maximum of 1,000,000 list item modifications in API requests over 12 hours.
- You can make a maximum of 30,000 API requests over 12 hours doing list item modifications.
