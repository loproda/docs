User Agent Blocking allows you to block specific browser or web application [`User-Agent` request headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent). User agent rules apply to the entire domain instead of individual subdomains.

User agent rules are applied after [zone lockdown rules](/waf/tools/zone-lockdown/). If you allow an IP address via Zone Lockdown, it will skip any user agent rules.

:::note

Cloudflare recommends that you use [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) instead of user agent rules to block specific user agents.

For example, a custom rule equivalent to the user agent [example rule](#create-a-user-agent-blocking-rule) provided in this page could have the following configuration:

- **Expression**: `http.user_agent eq "BadBot/1.0.2 (+http://bad.bot)"`
- **Action**: (a block or challenge action)

:::

## Availability

Cloudflare User Agent Blocking is available on all plans. However, this feature is only available in the [new security dashboard](/security/) if you have configured at least one user agent rule.

The number of available user agent rules depends on your Cloudflare plan.
