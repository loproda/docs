:::note
Only users with the [Super Administrator role](/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/) can configure payload logging and decrypt payloads in the Cloudflare dashboard. Other users can decrypt payloads if they have access to the logs and to the private key.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules** tab.

   ![Example Managed Rules configuration in the Managed rules tab under Security > WAF](~/assets/images/waf/waf-managed-rules-tab.png)

3. To configure payload logging for a ruleset you had already deployed in the WAF, select the managed ruleset name.

4. At the bottom of the page, select **Configure payload logging**.

5. After reading and understanding the implications of enabling payload logging, select one of the available options:
   - **Generate key pair using your web browser**: Generates a key pair (a private and a public key) in your browser and configures payload logging with the generated public key.

   - **Use my own public key**: Enter a public key [generated by the `matched-data-cli` command-line tool](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/command-line/generate-key-pair/).

6. Select **Next**.

7. If you generated a key pair in the browser, copy the displayed private key and **store it safely**. You will use this private key later to [view the decrypted payload content](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/view/).

8. Select **Done**.

9. If you are deploying the managed ruleset where you configured payload logging, select **Deploy**. If you configured payload logging for a ruleset you had already deployed, select **Save**.
