The Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection managed ruleset helps identify data leaks generated by your origin servers. Its rules run on the body of the response looking for patterns of common sensitive data, including:

- [Personally identifiable information](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-pii/) (PII) — For example, passport numbers.
- Financial information — For example, credit card numbers.
- Secrets — For example, API keys.

Turning on Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection will not introduce additional latency, since the detection occurs outside the response path. For this reason, rules are always deployed with the _Log_ action (you cannot block a response that was already sent), providing you with visibility on the sensitive data leaving your origin servers.

Some rules in the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection managed ruleset are disabled by default, to prevent false positives and a large number of logged events. You should review the PII and sensitive data relevant to your application and turn on the appropriate rules in the managed ruleset, according to the instructions in the following sections.

## Additional remarks

When turned on, Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection will check all responses sent to visitors (according to your custom filter expression, if defined), including responses from cache and responses handled by [Workers](/workers/).

The detection will handle text, HTML, JSON, and XML content in the response up to 1 MB.

Currently, Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection does not support [matched payload logging](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/).

## Configure in the dashboard

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

To configure Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection in the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Security** > **Sensitive Data**.

You can turn the managed ruleset on or off, and configure the following settings:

- Turn on or off specific rules or rules with specific tags.
- Customize the filter expression. With a custom expression, Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection applies only to a subset of the incoming requests.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

To enable Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Settings** and filter by **Detections**.
3. Turn on **Sensitive data detection**.

To adjust the scope of the managed ruleset or turn off specific rules:

1. In the **Settings** page, under **Sensitive data detection**, select **Configured ruleset**.
2. To apply the managed ruleset for a subset of incoming requests, select **Custom filter expression** and define the filter expression.
3. Select **Next**.
4. To turn specific rules on or off, select **Browse rules** and use the toggle next to each rule to turn it on or off.
5. Select **Next**, and then select **Save**.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

For details on configuring a managed ruleset in the dashboard, refer to [Configure a managed ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/deploy-zone-dashboard/#configure-a-managed-ruleset).

## Configure via API

To enable Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection for a given zone using the API, create a rule with `execute` action in the [entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) for the `http_response_firewall_managed` phase.

### Example

This example deploys the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection managed ruleset to the `http_response_firewall_managed` phase of a given zone (`$ZONE_ID`) by creating a rule that executes the managed ruleset. The rules in the managed ruleset are executed for all incoming requests.

## Review detected leaks

To check for any data leaks detected by Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection, you can do the following:

- Regularly check [Security Events](/waf/analytics/security-events/) for any events generated by the managed ruleset.
- Configure [WAF alerts](/waf/reference/alerts/) to be alerted of any spike of WAF events. For the Advanced Security Events Alert, you can filter by one or more domains on Enterprise plans and by the `Data Loss Protection` service to receive specific alerts about Sensitive Data Detection.
