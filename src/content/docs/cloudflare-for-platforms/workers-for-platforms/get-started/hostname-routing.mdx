You can use [dynamic dispatch](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/dynamic-dispatch/) Workers to route millions of vanity domains or subdomains to Workers without hitting traditional [route limits](/workers/platform/limits/#number-of-routes-per-zone). These hostnames can be subdomains under your managed domain (e.g. `customer1.saas.com`) or vanity domains controlled by your end customers (e.g. `mystore.com`), which can be managed through [custom hostnames](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/). 

## (Recommended) Wildcard route with a dispatch Worker

Configure a wildcard [Route](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/) (`*/*`) on your SaaS domain (the domain where you configure custom hostnames) to point to your dynamic dispatch Worker. This allows you to: 
- **Support both subdomains and vanity domains**: Handle `customer1.myplatform.com` (subdomain) and `shop.customer.com` (custom hostname) with the same routing logic. 
- **Avoid route limits**: Instead of creating individual routes for every domain, which can cause you to hit [Routes limits](/workers/platform/limits/#number-of-routes-per-zone), you can handle the routing logic in code and proxy millions of domains to individual Workers. 
- **Programmatically control routing logic**: Write custom code to route requests based on hostname, [custom metadata](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/custom-metadata/), path, or any other properties. 

:::note
This will route all traffic inbound to the domain to the dispatch Worker.
::: 

If you'd like to exclude certain hostnames from routing to the dispatch Worker, you can either:
- Add routes without a Worker specification to opt certain hostnames or paths from being executed by the dispatcher Worker (for example, for `saas.com`, `api.saas.com`, etc)
- Use a [dedicated domain](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/) (for example, `customers.saas.com`) for custom hostname and dispatch worker management to keep the rest of the traffic for that domain separate. 

### Setup

To set up hostname routing with a wildcard route:

1. **Configure custom hostnames**: Set up your domain and custom hostnames using [Cloudflare for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/)
2. **Set the fallback origin**: Set up a [fallback origin server](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/#1-create-fallback-origin), this is where all custom hostnames will be routed to. If you’d like to route them to separate origins, you can use a [custom origin server](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/custom-origin/). Requests will route through the Worker before reaching the origin. If the Worker is the origin then place a dummy DNS record for the fallback origin (e.g., `A 192.0.2.0`). 
3. **Configure DNS**: Point DNS records (subdomains or custom hostname) via [CNAME record to the saas domain](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/#3-have-customer-create-cname-record). If your customers need to proxy their apex hostname (e.g. `example.com`) and cannot use CNAME records, check out [Apex Proxying](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/apex-proxying/). 
4. **Create wildcard route**: Add a `*/*` route on your platform domain (e.g. saas.com) and associate it with your dispatch Worker.
5. **Implement dispatch logic**: Add logic to your dispatch Worker to route based on hostname, lookup mappings stored in [Workers KV]([Workers KV](/kv/)), or use [custom metadata](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/custom-metadata/) attached to custom hostnames. 

:::note
If you plan to route requests based on custom metadata, you'll need to create subdomains (e.g. `customer1.saas.com`) as custom hostnames. This is because DNS records do not support custom metadata.
:::

#### Example dispatch Worker

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const hostname = new URL(request.url).hostname;
    
    // Get custom hostname metadata for routing decisions
    const hostnameData = await env.KV.get(`hostname:${hostname}`, { type: 'json' });
    
    if (!hostnameData?.workerName) {
      return new Response('Hostname not configured', { status: 404 });
    }
    
    // Route to the appropriate user Worker
    const userWorker = env.DISPATCHER.get(hostnameData.workerName);
    return await userWorker.fetch(request);
  }
};
```

## Subdomain routing

If you're only looking to route subdomain records (e.g. `customer1.saas.com`), you can use a more specific route (`*.saas.com/*`) to route requests to your dispatch Worker. 

### Setup

To set up subdomain routing:

1. Create an orange-clouded wildcard DNS record: `*.saas.com` that points to the origin. If the Worker is the origin then you can use a dummy DNS value (for example, `A 192.0.2.0`). 
2. Set wildcard route: `*.saas.com/*` pointing to your dispatch Worker
3. Add logic to the dispatch Worker to route subdomain requests to the right Worker. 

#### Example subdomain dispatch Worker

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    const subdomain = url.hostname.split('.')[0];
    
    // Route based on subdomain
    if (subdomain && subdomain !== 'saas') {
      const userWorker = env.DISPATCHER.get(subdomain);
      return await userWorker.fetch(request);
    }
    
    return new Response('Invalid subdomain', { status: 400 });
  }
};
```

### Orange-to-Orange (o2o) Behavior

When your customers are also using Cloudflare and point their custom domain to your SaaS domain via CNAME (for example, `mystore.com` → `saas.com`), Worker routing behavior depends on whether the customer's DNS record is proxied (orange cloud) or DNS-only (grey cloud). Learn more about [Orange-to-Orange setups](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/#with-o2o)

This can cause inconsistent behavior when using specific hostname routes:
- If you're routing based on the CNAME target (`saas.com`), the custom hostname's DNS record must be orange-clouded for the Worker to be invoked.
- If you're routing based on the custom hostname (`mystore.com`), the customer's record must be grey-clouded for the Worker to be invoked.

Since you may not have control over your customer's DNS proxy settings, we recommend using `*/*` wildcard route to ensure routing logic always works as expected, regardless of how DNS is configured.

#### Worker invocation across route configurations and proxy modes

The table below shows when Workers are invoked based on your route pattern and the customer's DNS proxy settings:

| Route Pattern         | Custom Hostname (Orange Cloud) | Custom Hostname (Grey Cloud) |
|-----------------------|--------------|------------|
| `*/*` (Recommended)   | ✅           | ✅         | 
| Target hostname route | ✅           | ❌         |
| Custom hostname route | ❌           | ✅         |
