Test changes to your [dynamic dispatch Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dynamic-dispatch-worker) by running the dynamic dispatch Worker locally but connecting it to User Workers deployed in production. 

This is helpful when:
- **Testing routing changes** and validating that updates continue to work with deployed User Workers
- **Adding new middleware** like authentication, rate limiting, or logging to the dynamic dispatch Worker
- **Debugging issues** in the dynamic dispatcher that may be impacting deployed User Workers

### How to use remote dispatch namespaces

In the dynamic dispatch Worker's Wrangler file, configure the [dispatch namespace binding](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#dispatch-namespace-bindings-workers-for-platforms) to connect to the remote namespace by setting [`experimental_remote = true`](/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings):

<WranglerConfig>
```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
  "dispatch_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "DISPATCH_NAMESPACE",
      "namespace": "production",
      "experimental_remote": true
		}
  ]
}
```
</WranglerConfig>

This tells your dispatch Worker that's running locally to connect to the remote `production` namespace. When you run `wrangler dev`, your Dispatch Worker will route requests to the User Workers deployed in that namespace.

For more information about remote bindings during local development, refer to [remote bindings documentation](/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings).
