## How it works

For additional detail about how traffic routes when O2O is enabled, refer to [How O2O works](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/).

## Enable

Render customers can enable O2O on any Cloudflare zone plan. Cloudflare support for O2O setups is only available for Enterprise customers.

To enable O2O for a specific hostname within a Cloudflare zone, [create](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) a Proxied `CNAME` DNS record with your Render site name as the target. Render's domain addition setup will walk you through other validation steps.

| Type    | Name              | Target                                                     | Proxy status |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `CNAME` | `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` | `<RENDER_SUBDOMAIN>` (for example, `example.onrender.com`) | Proxied      |

:::note

For more details about Render setup, refer to their [documentation](https://render.com/docs/configure-cloudflare-dns).

If you cannot activate your domain using [proxied DNS records](/dns/proxy-status/), reach out to your Cloudflare account team or your Render support team.

### Additional requirements for wildcard subdomains

With O2O enabled, adding a wildcard subdomain to a Render service requires that the corresponding root domain is also routed to Render. If the root domain is routed elsewhere, wildcard routing will fail.

If your root domain needs to route somewhere besides Render, add individual subdomains to your Render service instead of a wildcard.

### Resolving SSL errors

If you encounter SSL errors, check if you have a `CAA` record.

If you have a `CAA` record, verify that it permits SSL certificates to be issued by Google Trust Services (`pki.goog`).

For more details, refer to [CAA records](/ssl/edge-certificates/troubleshooting/caa-records/#what-caa-records-are-added-by-cloudflare).
