<Description>

Build durable multi-step applications on Cloudflare Workers with Workflows.

</Description>

<Plan type="workers-all" />

With Workflows, you can build applications that chain together multiple steps, automatically retry failed tasks,
and persist state for minutes, hours, or even weeks - with no infrastructure to manage.

Workflows give you:

- Reliable multi-step operations without worrying about timeouts
- Automatic retries and error handling
- Built-in observability for long running operations
- Simple and expressive code for complex processes

```ts
export class CheckoutWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run (event, step) {
		const processorResponse = await step.do( 'submit payment', async () => {
			let resp = await submitToPaymentProcessor(event.params.payment) ;
			return await resp.json<any>();
		}) ;

		const textResponse = await step.do( 'send confirmation text', sendConfirmation);
		await step.sleep('wait for feedback', '2 days');
		await step.do('send feedback email', sendFeedbackEmail);
		await step.sleep('delay before marketing', '30 days');
		await step.do( 'send marketing follow up', sendFollowUp);
