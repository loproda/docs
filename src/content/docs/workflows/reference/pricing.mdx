:::note

Workflows is included in both the Free and Paid [Workers plans](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers).

:::

Workflows pricing is identical to [Workers Standard pricing](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) and are billed on three dimensions:

* **CPU time**: the total amount of compute (measured in milliseconds) consumed by a given Workflow.
* **Requests** (invocations): the number of Workflow invocations. [Subrequests](/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests) made from a Workflow do not incur additional request costs.
* **Storage**: the total amount of storage (measured in GB) persisted by your Workflows.

A Workflow that is waiting on a response to an API call, paused as a result of calling `step.sleep`, or otherwise idle, does not incur CPU time.

### Workflows Pricing

| Unit | Workers Free | Workers Paid |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Requests (millions) | 100,000 per day ([shared with Workers requests](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers)| 10 million included per month + $0.30 per additional million	|
| CPU time (ms) | 10 milliseconds of CPU time per invocation | 30 million CPU milliseconds included per month + $0.02 per additional million CPU milliseconds |
| Storage (GB-mo) | 1GB | 1GB included per month + $0.20/ GB-month |

:::note[CPU limits]

You can increase the CPU limit available to your Workflow instances up to 5 minutes per Workflow by [setting the `limits.cpu_ms` property](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#limits) in your Wrangler configuration.

### Storage Usage

:::note

Storage billing for Workflows will go live on September 15th, 2025.

:::

Storage is billed using gigabyte-month (GB-month) as the billing metric, identical to [Durable Objects SQL storage](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#sqlite-storage-backend). A GB-month is calculated by averaging the peak storage per day over a billing period (30 days).

* Storage is calculated across all instances, and includes running, errored, sleeping and completed instances.
* By default, instance state is retained for [3 days on the Free plan](/workflows/reference/limits/) and [7 days on the Paid plan](/workflows/reference/limits/).
* When creating a Workflow instance, you can set a shorter state retention period if you do not need to retain state for errored or completed Workflows.
* Deleting instances via the [Workers API](/workflows/build/workers-api/), [Wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/commands/#workflows), REST API, or dashboard will free up storage. Note that it may take a few minutes for storage limits to update.

An instance that attempts to store state when your have reached the storage limit on the Free plan will cause an error to be thrown.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Frequently asked questions related to Workflows pricing:

### Are there additional costs for Workflows?

No. Workflows are priced based on the same compute (CPU time), requests (invocations) as Workers, as well as storage (state from a Workflow).

### Are Workflows available on the [Workers Free](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) plan?

Yes.

### What is a Workflow invocation?

A Workflow invocation is when you trigger a new Workflow instance: for example, via the [Workers API](/workflows/build/workers-api/), wrangler CLI, or REST API. Steps within a Workflow are not invocations.

### How do Workflows show up on my bill?

Workflows are billed as Workers, and share the same CPU time and request SKUs.

### Are there any limits to Workflows?

Refer to the published [limits](/workflows/reference/limits/) documentation.
