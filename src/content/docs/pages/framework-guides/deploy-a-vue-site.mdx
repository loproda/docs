[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. A core principle of Vue is incremental adoption: this makes it easy to build Vue applications that live side-by-side with your existing code.

In this guide, you will create a new Vue application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages. You will use `vue-cli`, a batteries-included tool for generating new Vue applications.

## Setting up a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Vue's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Vue project, run the following command:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args="my-vue-app --framework=vue --platform=pages"
/>

<Render file="tutorials-before-you-start" />

<Render file="framework-guides/create-github-repository_no_init" />

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

<Render file="deploy-via-c3" params={{ name: "Vue" }} />

### Deploy via the Cloudflare dashboard

<Render file="deploy-to-pages-steps-with-preset" params={{ name: "Vue" }} />

<div>

<PagesBuildPreset framework="vue" />

</div>

After configuring your site, you can begin your first deploy. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `vue`, your project dependencies, and building your site, before deploying it.

:::note

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).

:::

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.
Every time you commit new code to your Vue application, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.
