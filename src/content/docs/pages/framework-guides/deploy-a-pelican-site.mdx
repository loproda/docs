[Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com) is a static site generator, written in Python. With Pelican, you can write your content directly with your editor of choice in reStructuredText or Markdown formats.

## Create a Pelican project

To begin, create a Pelican project directory. `cd` into your new directory and run:

```sh
python3 -m pip install pelican
```

Then run:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Create a directory in your project named `content`:

```sh
mkdir content
```

This is the directory name that you will set in the build command.

<Render file="tutorials-before-you-start" />

<Render file="framework-guides/create-github-repository" />

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

<Render file="deploy-to-pages-steps-with-preset" params={{ name: "Pelican" }} />

<PagesBuildPreset framework="pelican" />

4. Select **Environment variables (advanced)** and set the `PYTHON_VERSION` variable with the value of `3.7`.

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.

Every time you commit new code to your Pelican site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests and be able to preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.
