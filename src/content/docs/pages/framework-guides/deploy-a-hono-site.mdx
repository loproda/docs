[Hono](https://honojs.dev/) is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for Cloudflare Pages and Workers, Deno, and Bun. Learn more about the creation of Hono by [watching an interview](#creator-interview) with its creator, [Yusuke Wada](https://yusu.ke/).

In this guide, you will create a new Hono application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages.

## Create a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to create a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Hono's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Hono project, run the following command:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args="my-hono-app --framework=hono --platform=pages"
/>

In your new Hono project, you will find a `public/static` directory for your static files, and a `src/index.ts` file which is the entrypoint for your server-side code.

## Run in local dev

Develop your app locally by running:

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"dev"} />

You should be able to review your generated web application at `http://localhost:8788`.

<Render file="framework-guides/create-github-repository" />

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

<Render file="deploy-via-c3" params={{ name: "Hono" }} />

### Deploy via the Cloudflare dashboard

<Render file="deploy-to-pages-steps-no-preset" />

<div>

| Configuration option | Value           |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Production branch    | `main`          |
| Build command        | `npm run build` |
| Build directory      | `dist`          |

</div>

After configuring your site, you can begin your first deploy. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `my-hono-app`, your project dependencies, and building your site before deploying it.

:::note

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).

:::

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.
Every time you commit new code to your Hono site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.
