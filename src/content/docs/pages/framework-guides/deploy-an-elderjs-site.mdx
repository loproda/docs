[Elder.js](https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/) is an SEO-focused framework for building static sites with [SvelteKit](/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-kit-site/).

In this guide, you will create a new Elder.js application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages.

## Setting up a new project

Create a new project using [`npx degit Elderjs/template`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-init), giving it a project name:

```sh
npx degit Elderjs/template elderjs-app
cd elderjs-app
```

The Elder.js template includes a number of pages and examples showing how to build your static site, but by simply generating the project, it is already ready to be deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

<Render file="tutorials-before-you-start" />

<Render file="framework-guides/create-github-repository" />

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

<Render
	file="deploy-to-pages-steps-with-preset"
	params={{ name: "Elder.js" }}
/>

<PagesBuildPreset framework="elder-js" />

Optionally, you can customize the **Project name** field. It defaults to the GitHub repository's name, but it does not need to match. The **Project name** value is assigned as your `*.pages.dev` subdomain.

### Finalize Setup

After completing configuration, click the **Save and Deploy** button.

You will see your first deploy pipeline in progress. Pages installs all dependencies and builds the project as specified.

Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it on every new pushed commit.

Additionally, you will have access to [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/), which repeat the build-and-deploy process for pull requests. With these, you can preview changes to your project with a real URL before deploying them to production.
