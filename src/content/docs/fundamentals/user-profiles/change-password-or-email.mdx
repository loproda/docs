## Change email address

:::note

You cannot change your email address if your administrator has [enabled single sign-on (SSO)](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/dash-sso-apps/) or if you did not successfully verify the original email address. 

For example, if the email address was entered incorrectly or is a non-working email address, you will need to create a new account with a working email address and [move domains](/fundamentals/manage-domains/move-domain/).

:::

To change the email address associated with your Cloudflare account:

1. Go to your [Profile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/profile).
2. Select your account.
3. In the Email Address panel, select **Change Email Address**.
4. In the dialog, enter your new email address in **New email** and **Confirm email**.
5. Enter your current password.
6. Select **Save**.

## Forgot your email address

:::note

If you are an Enteprise customer and forgot the email address associated with your account, contact your Customer Success Manager.
:::

If you forget the email address associated with your application:

1. Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select **Forgot your email?**.
2. Enter your domain name.
3. Cloudflare will send an email to the email address associated with your domain name. If you do not receive an email within 20 minutes, check your spam folder. The message will be sent from `no-reply@cloudflare.com` or `noreply@notify.cloudflare.com`.

:::note

This process does not affect your account or share your email address with anyone.
:::

If you still cannot access the email address associated with your Cloudflare account, you may need to [move your domain to another account](/fundamentals/manage-domains/move-domain/).

Cloudflare requires these steps to prevent account hijacking.

## Change password

:::note
If your administrator has [enabled Single sign-on (SSO)](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/dash-sso-apps/), you cannot change your **Authentication** settings.
:::

To change your Cloudflare password:

1. Go to your [Profile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/profile).
2. Select your account.
3. Select **Authentication**.
4. On **Password**, select **Change Password**.
5. Change your password and select **Save**.

For added account security, consider changing your [API tokens](/fundamentals/api/how-to/roll-token/) as well.
