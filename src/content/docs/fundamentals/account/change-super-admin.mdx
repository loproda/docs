title: Change Super Administrator

---

If you or someone in your organization leaves or loses access to email, you can add another Super Administrator using any other Super Administrator on your Account with a [verified email](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/verify-email-address/) address.

First, [add a member](/fundamentals/manage-members/manage/) to your account and assign the **Super Administrator** role.

Then, if needed, remove the previous Super Administrator.
