To create a Cloudflare account:

1. Go to the [Sign up page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
2. Enter your **Email** and **Password**.
3. Select **Create Account**.

Once you create your account, Cloudflare will automatically send an email to your address to [verify that email address](/fundamentals/user-profiles/verify-email-address/).

## Account name

Your account name defaults to `<<YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>>'s Account`.

You may want to customize the name of this account, either to help specify its purpose or to help associate it with multiple accounts.

To change your account name:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **Manage Account** > **Configurations**.
3. For **Account Name**, select **Change Name**.
4. Enter a new account name.
5. Select **Save**.

## Best practices

Refer to [Account and domain management best practices](/fundamentals/reference/best-practices/) for a detailed list of ways to protect your account and domain. 

Once you [set up an account](/fundamentals/account/), you have several ways to interact with Cloudflare.

## Interact with Cloudflare 

If you prefer working without code, you can manage your account and domain settings through the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).

:::note

If your domain was added to Cloudflare by a hosting partner, manage your DNS records via the hosting partner.

For those who prefer to interact with Cloudflare programmatically, you can use several methods:
