Once you have [added your domain to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/) and [updated your nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/), you also might want to set up a subdomain.

Most subdomains serve a specific purpose within the overall context of your website. For example, `blog.example.com` might be your blog, `support.example.com` could be your customer help portal, and `store.example.com` would be your e-commerce site.

## Create a subdomain

If you have already added a subdomain at your host, create a corresponding [DNS A or CNAME record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) for that subdomain (`blog`, `store`).

## Set up redirects

### Redirect a subdomain to the apex domain

Sometimes, you might want all traffic to a subdomain (`www.example.com`)  to actually go to your apex domain (`example.com`).

1. Create a [proxied DNS A record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) for your subdomain. This record can point to any IP address since all traffic will be redirected prior to reaching the address.

   | **Type** | **Name** | **IPv4 address** | **Proxy status** |
   | -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
   | A        | `www`    | `192.0.2.1`      | Proxied          |

2. Create a [Single Redirect](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/create-dashboard/) to forward traffic from your subdomain to your apex domain.

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

Using the Expression Editor:<br/>
`(http.request.full_uri contains "www.example.com")`

**Then**

* **Type:** *Dynamic*
* **Expression:** `concat("https://","example.com",http.request.uri.path)`
* **Status code:** *301*

   | A        | `@`      | `192.0.2.1`      | Proxied          |

3. Create a [Single Redirect](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/create-dashboard/) to forward traffic from your apex domain to your subdomain.

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

Using the Expression Editor:<br/>
`(lower(http.host) eq "example.com")`

**Then**

* **Type:** *Dynamic*
* **Expression:** `concat("https://","www.example.com",http.request.uri.path)`
* **Status code:** *301*
