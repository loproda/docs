[Magic Transit](/magic-transit/) customers using BYOIP can also benefit from the performance, reliability, and security that Cloudflare offers for HTTP-based applications. [Service bindings](/byoip/service-bindings/) allow BYOIP customers to selectively route traffic on a per-IP address basis to the CDN pipeline (which includes [Cache](/cache/), [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/waf/), and more).

This guide covers using the Cloudflare API to configure Magic Transit with CDN. It is also possible to define service bindings to route traffic to the Spectrum pipeline selectively. Refer to [scope](/byoip/service-bindings/#scope) for the full list of possible configurations and other available guides.

It is important to note that traffic routed to the CDN pipeline is protected at Layers 3 and 4 by the inherent DDoS protection capabilities native to the CDN pipeline.

## Before you begin

<Render
file="service-bindings-prereqs"
params={{
	pre_existing_product: "Magic Transit",
	added_product: "CDN"
}}
/>

## 1. Get account information

<Render
file="service-bindings-account-info"
params={{
	pre_existing_product: "Magic Transit",
	added_product: "CDN"
}}
/>

## 2. Create service binding

<Render
file="service-bindings-create-binding"
params={{
	pre_existing_product: "Magic Transit",
	added_product: "CDN"
}}
/>

## 3. Create address maps

Once you have configured your IPs to have CDN service, you can use <GlossaryTooltip term="address map" link="/byoip/address-maps/">address maps</GlossaryTooltip> to specify which IPs should be used by Cloudflare in DNS responses when a record is <GlossaryTooltip term="proxy status" link="/dns/proxy-status/">proxied</GlossaryTooltip>.

You can choose between two different scopes:

- Account-level: uses the address map for all proxied DNS records across all of the zones within an account.
- Zone-level: uses the address map for all proxied DNS records within a zone.

:::note
If you need to map only specific subdomains (and not all proxied DNS records) to specific IP addresses, you can use a [Subdomain setup](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/).
:::

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI">
<TabItem label="Dashboard" no-code="true">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **IP Addresses** > **Address Maps**.
3. Select **Create an address map**.
4. Choose the scope of the address map.
5. Add the zones and IP addresses that you want to map.
6. Name your address map.
7. Review the information and select **Save and Deploy**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="API" no-code="true">

Use the [Create Address Map](/api/resources/addressing/subresources/address_maps/methods/create/) endpoint.

Make sure you have the correct Key/Token and permissions.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 4. Create DNS records

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI">
<TabItem label="Dashboard" no-code="true">

To create a DNS record in the dashboard:

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select an account and domain.
2.  Go to **DNS** > **Records**.
3.  Select **Add record**.
4.  Choose an address (`A`/`AAAA`) [record type](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/).
5.  Complete the required fields, setting the **Proxy status** to **proxied**.
6.  Select **Save**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="API" no-code="true">

To create records with the API, use a [POST request](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/create/). For field definitions, select a record type under the request body specification.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
As you create the necessary DNS records, [Total TLS](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/total-tls/) can help making sure that you have SSL/TLS certificates in place for all your hostnames.
:::

While the DNS record proxy status and address map will determine how Cloudflare's authoritative DNS responds to requests for your hostnames, the IP addresses specified in `A`/`AAAA` records will determine [how Cloudflare reaches the configured origin](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#how-cloudflare-works-as-a-reverse-proxy).

<Details header="Example">

| Type | Name  | IP address      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ----- | --------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| `A`  | `www` | `203.0.113.150` | `Proxied`    | `Auto` |

At this point, if an address map for a zone `example.com` specifies that Cloudflare should use `203.0.113.100` for proxied records and the above record exists in the same zone, you can expect the following:

1. Cloudflare responds to DNS requests with `203.0.113.100`.
2. Cloudflare proxies requests through the CDN and then routes the requests via [GRE](/magic-transit/reference/gre-ipsec-tunnels/) or [CNI](/magic-transit/network-interconnect/) to the origin server `203.0.113.150` (which is within the Magic Transit protected prefix).
3. Depending on whether Magic Transit is implemented with [direct server return model or with Magic Transit egress](/magic-transit/how-to/configure-tunnel-endpoints/#bidirectional-vs-unidirectional-health-checks), the origin server responds back to Cloudflare either:

   - Directly over the Internet in a Magic Transit direct server return model
   - Back through the Magic GRE tunnel(s) in a Magic Transit egress model

4. As the HTTP response egresses the Cloudflare network back to the client side, the source IP address of the response becomes `203.0.113.100` (the IP address that the HTTP request originally landed on).

</Details>

:::note
Having the same IP address as ingress IP (defined in the address map) and origin IP (listed in the DNS record) will not cause any loops.
:::

<Details header="Example">

Assuming `203.0.113.100` was also the origin IP, the DNS record would look like the following:

| Type | Name  | IP address      | Proxy status | TTL    |
| ---- | ----- | --------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| `A`  | `www` | `203.0.113.100` | `Proxied`    | `Auto` |

</Details>

## 5. (Optional) Add layer 7 functionality
