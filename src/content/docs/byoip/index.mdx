Get Cloudflare's security and performance while using your own IPs.
</Description>

<Plan type="enterprise" />

Considering [how Cloudflare works as a reverse proxy](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/), for some customers it may be important to maintain this functionality while also keeping their website or application associated with their own public IP space (instead of Cloudflare's[^1]).

With Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP), Cloudflare announces your IPs in all our locations. Use your IPs with [Magic Transit](/magic-transit/), [Spectrum](/spectrum/), [CDN services](/cache/), or Gateway [DNS locations](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/locations/) and [dedicated egress IPs](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/dedicated-egress-ips/).

Learn how to [get started](/byoip/get-started/).

[^1]: Without BYOIP, when your domain's records are `proxied`, Cloudflare responds with a Cloudflare-owned [anycast IP address](/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/).
