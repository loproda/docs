import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

The following example shows you how to publish messages to a Queue from a Worker. The example uses a Worker that receives a JSON payload from the request body and writes it as-is to the Queue, but in a real application you might have more logic before you queue a message.

## Prerequisites

- A [queue created](/queues/get-started/#3-create-a-queue) via the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) or the [wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
- A [configured **producer** binding](/queues/configuration/configure-queues/#producer-worker-configuration) in the Cloudflare dashboard or Wrangler file.

Configure your Wrangler file as follows:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "my-worker"

[[queues.producers]]
  queue = "my-queue"
  binding = "YOUR_QUEUE"

```

</WranglerConfig>

### 1. Create the Worker

The following Worker script:

1. Validates that the request body is valid JSON.
2. Publishes the payload to the queue.

```ts
interface Env {
	YOUR_QUEUE: Queue;
}

export default {
	async fetch(req, env): Promise<Response> {
		// Validate the payload is JSON
		// In a production application, we may more robustly validate the payload
		// against a schema using a library like 'zod'
		let messages;
		try {
			messages = await req.json();
		} catch (e) {
			// Return a HTTP 400 (Bad Request) if the payload isn't JSON
			return Response.json({ err: "payload not valid JSON" }, { status: 400 });
		}

		// Publish to the Queue
		try {
			await env.YOUR_QUEUE.send(messages);
		} catch (e: any) {
			console.log(`failed to send to the queue: ${e}`);
			// Return a HTTP 500 (Internal Error) if our publish operation fails
			return Response.json({ error: e.message }, { status: 500 });
		}

		// Return a HTTP 200 if the send succeeded!
		return Response.json({ success: true });
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

To deploy this Worker:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

### 2. Send a test message

To make sure you successfully write a message to your queue, use `curl` on the command line:

```sh
# Make sure to replace the placeholder with your shared secret
curl -XPOST "https://YOUR_WORKER.YOUR_ACCOUNT.workers.dev" --data '{"messages": [{"msg":"hello world"}]}'
```

```sh output
{"success":true}
```

This will issue a HTTP POST request, and if successful, return a HTTP 200 with a `success: true` response body.

- If you receive a HTTP 400, this is because you attempted to send malformed JSON to your queue.
- If you receive a HTTP 500, this is because the message was not written to your Queue successfully.

You can use [`wrangler tail`](/workers/observability/logs/real-time-logs/) to debug the output of `console.log`.
