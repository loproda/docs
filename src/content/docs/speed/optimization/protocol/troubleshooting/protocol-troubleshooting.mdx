This guide covers common HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 issues, including origin incompatibility, multiplexing errors, and browser errors, with steps to diagnose and resolve them.

## H2 to Origin - Origin incompatibility

- The origin's `max_concurrent_streams` is negotiated during the handshake process. 
- If a `GOAWAY(0)` is received, it is likely due to a server restart or another reason causing the server to refuse new streams.
- For more information, refer to [RFC 9113 - SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113).

## H2 Multiplexing - Origin incompatibility/issues

- Multiplexing issues can arise due to incorrect server configurations. 
- Use [netlogs](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-stack/netlog/) to identify `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` violations or unexpected `GOAWAY` frames.
- For more information, refer to [Stream Concurrency Issues](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113#name-stream-concurrency).

## Generic browser errors 

Common browser errors include:

- `ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`
- `ERR_HTTP3_PROTOCOL_ERROR`
- `ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR`

These errors do not necessarily indicate a protocol-level issue. Follow these steps:

1. Attempt reproduction using HTTP/1.1.
2. If the issue persists in HTTP/1.1, address the underlying error before testing HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.
3. If the issue does not persist, analyze netlogs for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3-specific issues.

For more information, refer to [Chromium URL Request Header](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/net/url_request/url_request.h).
