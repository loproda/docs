You can deploy a managed ruleset at the zone level or at the account level. To deploy a managed ruleset to a phase, use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/).

If you are using Terraform, refer to [WAF Managed Rules configuration using Terraform](/terraform/additional-configurations/waf-managed-rulesets/) for more information.

If you are using the Cloudflare dashboard, refer to the following pages:

- [Deploy a WAF managed ruleset in the dashboard (zone)](/waf/managed-rules/deploy-zone-dashboard/)
- [Deploy a WAF managed ruleset in the dashboard (account)](/waf/account/managed-rulesets/deploy-dashboard/)

## Deploy a managed ruleset to a phase at the zone level

Use the following workflow to deploy a managed ruleset to a phase at the zone level.

1. Get your [zone ID](/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).
2. Invoke the [List account rulesets](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/) operation to obtain the available managed rulesets. Managed rulesets exist at the account level, but you can deploy them to a zone. Find the ruleset ID of the managed ruleset you want to deploy.
3. Identify the [phase](/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) where you want to deploy the managed ruleset. Ensure that the managed ruleset belongs to the same phase where you want to deploy it.
4. Add a rule to the zone-level phase [entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) that executes the managed ruleset. Refer to the following example for details on this step.

### Example

<Render file="managed-rulesets/api-zone-example" product="waf" />

In this example, the managed ruleset executes the behavior configured by Cloudflare. To customize the behavior of managed rulesets, refer to [Override a managed ruleset](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/).

## Deploy a managed ruleset to a phase at the account level

Use the following workflow to deploy a managed ruleset to a phase at the account level.

1. Get your [account ID](/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).
2. Invoke the [List account rulesets](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/) operation to obtain the available managed rulesets. Find the ruleset ID of the managed ruleset you want to deploy.
3. Identify the [phase](/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) where you want to deploy the managed ruleset. Ensure that the managed ruleset belongs to the same phase where you want to deploy it.
4. Add a rule to the account-level phase [entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) that executes the managed ruleset. Use parentheses to enclose any custom conditions in the rule expression and end your expression with `and cf.zone.plan eq "ENT"` so that it only applies to zones on an Enterprise plan. Refer to the following example for details on this step.

### Example

<Render file="managed-rulesets/api-account-example" product="waf" />

In this example, the managed ruleset executes the behavior configured by Cloudflare. To learn how to customize the behavior of managed rulesets, refer to [Override a managed ruleset](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/).
