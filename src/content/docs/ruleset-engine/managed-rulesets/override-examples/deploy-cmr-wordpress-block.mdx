Follow the steps below to create a rule that executes a managed ruleset and defines an override for rules with a specific tag.

1. [Add a rule](/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/deploy-rulesets/) to a phase entry point ruleset that executes a managed ruleset.
2. [Configure a tag override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that sets a specified action for all rules with a given tag.

The example below uses the [Update a zone entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to perform the two steps in a single `PUT` request.

- Set the list of rules in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset to a single rule that executes the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/).
- Override rules with the `wordpress` tag to set the action to `block`. All other rules use the default action provided by the ruleset issuer.
