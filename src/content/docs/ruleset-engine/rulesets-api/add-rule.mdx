import { Render, APIRequest } from "~/components";

Adds a single rule to an existing ruleset. Use this endpoint to add a rule without having to include all the existing ruleset rules in the request.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

- [Create an account ruleset rule](/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/rules/methods/create/)<br/>
  `POST /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules`
- [Create a zone ruleset rule](/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/rules/methods/create/)<br/>
  `POST /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules`

Include the rule definition in the request body.

By default, the rule will be added to the end of the existing list of rules in the ruleset. To define a specific position for the rule, include a `position` object in the request body according to the guidelines in [Change the order of a rule in a ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update-rule/#change-the-order-of-a-rule-in-a-ruleset).

Invoking this method creates a new version of the ruleset.

## Example

The following `POST` request adds a rule to ruleset `$RULESET_ID` of zone `$ZONE_ID`. The ruleset ID was previously obtained using the [List zone rulesets](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/list/) operation, and corresponds to the entry point ruleset for the `http_request_firewall_custom` phase.

The response will include the complete ruleset after adding the rule.

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		action: "js_challenge",
		expression:
			'(ip.src.country in {"GB" "FR"} and cf.bot_management.score < 20 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot)',
		description: "challenge GB and FR based on bot score",
	}}
/>

```json output

	"result": {
		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",

	},

}
```

## Define the rule position in the ruleset

To define the position of the new rule in the ruleset, include a `position` object in the request, containing one of the following:

<Render file="rule-position-values" />

For examples of using a `position` object, refer to [Update a rule in a ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update-rule/#examples).
