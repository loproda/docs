import { APIRequest } from "~/components";

You can use the API to delete all the versions of a ruleset or delete a specific version of a ruleset.

- [Delete ruleset (all versions)](#delete-ruleset)
- [Delete ruleset version](#delete-ruleset-version)

## Delete ruleset

Deletes all the versions of an existing ruleset at the account or zone level.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

- [Delete an account ruleset](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/delete/)<br/>
  `DELETE /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}`
- [Delete a zone ruleset](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/delete/)<br/>
  `DELETE /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}`

If the delete operation succeeds, the API method call returns a `204 No Content` HTTP status code.

:::note

You cannot delete a ruleset that is still referenced in other rules. For example, you cannot delete a custom ruleset that is being deployed in a rule with `execute` action.

To delete the ruleset, update or delete any rules that reference the ruleset and try again.

:::

### Example

The following example request deletes an existing ruleset with ID `$RULESET_ID`.

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}"
	method="DELETE"
/>

## Delete ruleset version

Deletes a specific version of a ruleset.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

- [Delete an account ruleset version](/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/versions/methods/delete/)<br/>
  `DELETE /accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/versions/{version_number}`
- [Delete a zone ruleset version](/api/resources/rulesets/subresources/versions/methods/delete/)<br/>
  `DELETE /zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/versions/{version_number}`

If the delete operation succeeds, the method call returns a `204 No Content` HTTP status code.

Later updates to the ruleset will not reuse the version number of a deleted ruleset version.

:::note

You cannot delete a ruleset version if it is the latest ruleset version and there is a rule with `execute` action deploying that ruleset.

To delete the ruleset version, update or delete any rules that reference the ruleset and try again.

:::

### Example

The following example request deletes a version of an existing ruleset.

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/versions/{ruleset_version}"
	method="DELETE"
/>
