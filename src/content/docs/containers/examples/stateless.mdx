To simply proxy requests to one of multiple instances of a container, you can use the `getRandom` function:

```ts
import { Container, getRandom } from "@cloudflare/containers";

const INSTANCE_COUNT = 3;

class Backend extends Container {
	defaultPort = 8080;
	sleepAfter = "2h";
}

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		// note: "getRandom" to be replaced with latency-aware routing in the near future
		const containerInstance = getRandom(env.BACKEND, INSTANCE_COUNT);
		return containerInstance.fetch(request);
	},
};
```

:::note
This example uses the `getRandom` function, which is a temporary helper that will randomly
select of of N instances of a Container to route requests to.

In the future, we will provide improved latency-aware load balancing and autoscaling.

This will make scaling stateless instances simple and routing more efficient. See the
[autoscaling documentation](/containers/scaling-and-routing) for more details.
