import { WranglerConfig, PackageManagers } from "~/components";

Environment variables can be passed into a Container using the `envVars` field
in the `Container` class, or by setting manually when the Container starts.

Secrets can be passed into a Container by using [Worker Secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets/)
or the [Secret Store](/secrets-store/integrations/workers/), then passing them into the Container
as environment variables.

These examples show the various ways to pass in secrets and environment variables. In each, we will
be passing in:

- the variable `"ACCOUNT_NAME"` as a hard-coded environment variable
- the secret `"CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY"` as a secret from Worker Secrets
- the secret `"ACCOUNT_API_KEY"` as a secret from the Secret Store

In practice, you may just use one of the methods for storing secrets, but
we will show both for completeness.

## Creating secrets

First, let's create the `"CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY"` secret in Worker Secrets:

<PackageManagers
	type="exec"
	pkg="wrangler"
	args="secret put CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY"
/>

Then, let's create a store called "demo" in the Secret Store, and add
the `"ACCOUNT_API_KEY"` secret to it:

<PackageManagers
	type="exec"
	pkg="wrangler"
	args="secrets-store store create demo --remote"
/>

<PackageManagers
	type="exec"
	pkg="wrangler"
	args="secrets-store secret create demo --name ACCOUNT_API_KEY --scopes workers --remote"
/>

For full details on how to create secrets, see the [Workers Secrets documentation](/workers/configuration/secrets/)
and the [Secret Store documentation](/secrets-store/integrations/workers/).

## Adding a secrets binding

Next, we need to add bindings to access our secrets and environment variables
in Wrangler configuration.

<WranglerConfig>

```json
{
	"name": "my-container-worker",
	"vars": {
		"ACCOUNT_NAME": "my-account"
	},
	"secrets_store_secrets": [
		{
			"binding": "SECRET_STORE",
			"store_id": "demo",
			"secret_name": "ACCOUNT_API_KEY"
		}
	]
	// rest of the configuration...
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

Note that `"CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY"` does not need to be set, at it is automatically
added to `env`.

Also note that we did not configure anything specific for environment variables
or secrets in the container-related portion of wrangler configuration.

## Using `envVars` on the Container class

Now, let's pass the env vars and secrets to our container using the `envVars` field in the `Container` class:

```js
// https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#importing-env-as-a-global
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";
export class MyContainer extends Container {
	defaultPort = 8080;
	sleepAfter = "10s";
	envVars = {
		ACCOUNT_NAME: env.ACCOUNT_NAME,
		ACCOUNT_API_KEY: env.SECRET_STORE.ACCOUNT_API_KEY,
		CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY: env.CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY,
	};
}
```

Every instance of this `Container` will now have these variables and secrets
set as environment variables when it launches.

## Setting environment variables per-instance

But what if you want to set environment variables on a per-instance basis?

In this case, set `manualStart` then use the `start` method to pass in environment variables for each instance.
We'll assume that we've set additional secrets in the Secret Store.

```js
export class MyContainer extends Container {
	defaultPort = 8080;
	sleepAfter = "10s";
	manualStart = true;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		if (new URL(request.url).pathname === "/launch-instances") {
			let idOne = env.MY_CONTAINER.idFromName("foo");
			let instanceOne = env.MY_CONTAINER.get(idOne);

			let idTwo = env.MY_CONTAINER.idFromName("foo");
			let instanceTwo = env.MY_CONTAINER.get(idTwo);

			// Each instance gets a different set of environment variables

			await instanceOne.start({
				envVars: {
					ACCOUNT_NAME: env.ACCOUNT_NAME + "-1",
					ACCOUNT_API_KEY: env.SECRET_STORE.ACCOUNT_API_KEY_ONE,
					CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY: env.CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY_TWO,
				},
			});

			await instanceTwo.start({
				envVars: {
					ACCOUNT_NAME: env.ACCOUNT_NAME + "-2",
					ACCOUNT_API_KEY: env.SECRET_STORE.ACCOUNT_API_KEY_TWO,
					CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY: env.CONTAINER_SECRET_KEY_TWO,
				},
			});
			return new Response("Container instances launched");
		}

		// ... etc ...
	},
};
```
