## Pushing images during `wrangler deploy`

When running `wrangler deploy`, if you set the `image` attribute in you [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#containers)
file to a path, wrangler will build your container image locally using Docker, then push it to a registry run by Cloudflare.
This registry is integrated with your Cloudflare account and is backed by [R2](/r2/). All authentication is handled automatically by
Cloudflare both when pushing and pulling images.

Just provide the path to your Dockerfile:

<WranglerConfig>

```json
{
	"containers": {
		"image": "./Dockerfile"
		// ...rest of config...
	}
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

And deploy your Worker with `wrangler deploy`. No other image management is necessary.

On subsequent deploys, Wrangler will only push image layers that have changed, which saves space and time on `wrangler deploy`
calls after the initial deploy.

:::note
Docker or a Docker-compatible CLI tool must be running for Wrangler to build and push images.

## Using pre-built container images

If you wish to use a pre-built image, first, push it to the Cloudflare Registry:

Wrangler provides a command to push images to the Cloudflare Registry:

<PackageManagers
	type="exec"
	pkg="wrangler"
	args="containers push <image>:<tag>"
/>

Additionally, you can use the `-p` flag with `wrangler containers build` to build and push an image in one step:

<PackageManagers
	type="exec"
	pkg="wrangler"
	args="containers build -p -t <tag> ."
/>

Then you can specify the URL in the image attribute:

<WranglerConfig>

```json
{
	"containers": {
		"image": "registry.cloudflare.com/your-image:tag"
		// ...rest of config...
	}
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

Currently, all images must use `registry.cloudflare.com`, which is the default registry for Wrangler.

To use an existing image from another repo, you can pull it, tag it, then push it to the Cloudflare Registry:

```bash
docker pull <public-image>
docker tag <public-image> <image>:<tag>
wrangler containers push <image>:<tag>
```

:::note
We plan to allow configuring public images directly in Wrangler config. Cloudflare will
download your image, optionally using auth credentials, then cache it globally in the Cloudflare Registry.

This is not yet available.

## Pushing images with CI

To use an image built in a continuous integration environment, install `wrangler` then
build and pushi images using either `wrangler containers build` with the `--push` flag, or
using the `wrangler containers push` command.

## Registry Limits

Images are limited to 2 GB in size and you are limited to 50 total GB in your account's registry.

:::note
These limits will likely increase in the future.
:::

Delete images with `wrangler containers delete` to free up space, but note that reverting a
Worker to a previous version that uses a deleted image will then error.
