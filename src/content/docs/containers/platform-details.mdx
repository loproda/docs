## Instance Types

The memory, vCPU, and disk space for Containers are set through predefined instance types.
Three instance types are currently available:

| Instance Type | Memory  | vCPU | Disk |
| ------------- | ------- | ---- | ---- |
| dev           | 256 MiB | 1/16 | 2 GB |
| basic         | 1 GiB   | 1/4  | 4 GB |
| standard      | 4 GiB   | 1/2  | 4 GB |

These are specified using the [`instance_type` property](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#containers) in your Worker's Wrangler configuration file. Looking for larger instances? [Give us feedback here](/containers/beta-info/#feedback-wanted) and tell us what size instances you need, and what you want to use them for.

## Limits

While in open beta, the following limits are currently in effect:

| Feature                                               | Workers Paid                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| GB Memory for all concurrent live Container instances | 40GB [^1]                                      |
| vCPU for all concurrent live Container instances      | 20 [^1]                                        |
| GB Disk for all concurrent live Container instances   | 100GB [^1]                                     |
| Image size                                            | Same as [instance disk space](#instance-types) |
| Total image storage per account                       | 50 GB [^2]                                     |

[^1]: This limit will be raised as we continue the beta.

[^2]: Delete container images with `wrangler containers delete` to free up space. Note that if you delete a container image and then [roll back](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/rollbacks/) your Worker to a previous version, this version may no longer work.

## Environment variables

The container runtime automatically sets the following variables:

- `CLOUDFLARE_APPLICATION_ID` - the ID of the Containers application
- `CLOUDFLARE_COUNTRY_A2` - the [ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) of a country the container is placed in
- `CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT_ID` - the ID of the container instance
- `CLOUDFLARE_LOCATION` - a name of a location the container is placed in
- `CLOUDFLARE_PLACEMENT_ID` - a placement ID
- `CLOUDFLARE_REGION` - a region name
- `CLOUDFLARE_DURABLE_OBJECT_ID` - the ID of the Durable Object that the container is bound to

:::note
If you supply environment variables with the same names, supplied values will override predefined values.
:::

Custom environment variables can be set when defining a Container in your Worker:

```javascript
class MyContainer extends Container {
	defaultPort = 4000;
	envVars = {
		MY_CUSTOM_VAR: "value",
		ANOTHER_VAR: "another_value",
	};
}
```
