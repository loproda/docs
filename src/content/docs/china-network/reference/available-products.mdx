[^1]: Durable Objects cannot be created within China, all new instances will be created outside. Invoking a Durable Object still works as normal.
[^2]: [Image Resizing works within Workers](/images/transform-images/transform-via-workers/) but not through [URL format](/images/transform-images/transform-via-url/).
[^3]: R2 buckets cannot be created within China and [custom domains](/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#add-your-domain-to-cloudflare) are not supported within China. You can use [Worker bindings](/r2/api/workers/workers-api-usage/) however.
