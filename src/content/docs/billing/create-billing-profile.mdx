## Add a primary payment method

A primary payment method is required to process payment for Cloudflare products and services. We value your confidentiality and privacy - Cloudflare does not have access to your bank, credit card, pin, or PayPal account password details.

:::note
Customers on an [Enterprise plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/contact/) have [additional payment options](/billing/create-billing-profile/#payment-options) such as wire and ACH, as well as yearly or quarterly billing.
:::

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to **Manage account** > **Billing**.
3. Select **Payment**. If no payment method is on file, the **Payment methods** dialog opens automatically.
4. Select **Manage** next to your current payment method. The **Manage payment methods** dialog opens.
5. Enter the required information based on the payment options below:  
    **Credit card**:
     1. Enter the required information under the **Credit Card Details** form.
     2. If applicable, add your business information to your invoice, including your **Company** and **VAT/GST Number**.

    **PayPal** (Your credit card will be charged if you have insufficient funds in your PayPal account):
     1. Select the **PayPal**.
     2. Follow the online instructions until PayPal returns you to the Cloudflare **Payment Method** to continue your set-up.
     3. Verify your **PayPal username** now appears next to the PayPal logo.
     4. Add your account contact information as well as **Company** and **VAT/GST Number**, if applicable.

:::note
Because some countries tax goods and services on personal accounts, you may be asked to indicate whether your Cloudflare account is personal or business to determine tax eligibility.
:::

6. Review the payment method and contact information to ensure it is accurate.
7. To finish, select **Confirm**.
8. Ensure your new payment method appears in the **Payment Method** section.

Enterprise customers must email [ar@cloudflare.com](mailto:ar@cloudflare.com) with the last four digits of the credit card and its expiration date.

## Add a backup payment method

Optionally, add a backup payment method to use if the primary payment method fails.
