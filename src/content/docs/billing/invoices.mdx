## Billing cycles

Monthly and annual billing subscriptions run on different billing cycles.

The first monthly purchase on a Cloudflare account sets the billing date for the following monthly subscriptions. The same behaviour occurs for annual subscriptions.

You can have two different billing cycles on your account, one for a monthly subscription and another for an annual subscription.
