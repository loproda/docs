<Description>

Secure your organization with Cloudflare Zero Trust — a cloud security model that replaces legacy perimeters with Cloudflare’s global network.

</Description>

<Plan type="all" />

Cloudflare Zero Trust is part of Cloudflare One, our name for the Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platform that protects enterprise applications, users, devices, and networks.

By progressively adopting Cloudflare One, organizations can move away from a patchwork of hardware appliances and point solutions, and instead consolidate security and networking through a unified control plane that includes products like [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/), [Secure Web Gateway (SWG)](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/), [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/), [Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/), [Remote Browser Isolation (RBI)](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/), [Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)](/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/), and [Email Security](/cloudflare-one/email-security/).

Refer to our [SASE reference architecture](/reference-architecture/architectures/sase/) to learn how to plan, deploy, and manage SASE architecture with Cloudflare.
