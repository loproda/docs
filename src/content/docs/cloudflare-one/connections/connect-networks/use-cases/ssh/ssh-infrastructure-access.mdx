[Access for Infrastructure](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/) provides granular control over how users can connect to your SSH servers. This feature uses the same deployment model as [WARP-to-Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/ssh-warp-to-tunnel/) but unlocks more policy options and command logging functionality.

<Render
	file="access/short-lived-certs-intro"
	params={{ intro: "Furthermore, Access for Infrastructure replaces" }}
/>

## 1. Connect the server to Cloudflare

<Render file="tunnel/connect-private-network" />

<Render file="tunnel/connect-private-network-infra-access" />

## 2. Set up the client

To connect your devices to Cloudflare:

1. [Deploy the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/) on your devices in Gateway with WARP mode.
2. [Enable the Gateway proxy for TCP](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/proxy/#turn-on-the-gateway-proxy).
3. [Create device enrollment rules](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/device-enrollment/) to determine which devices can enroll to your Zero Trust organization.

## 3. Route server IPs through WARP

<Render file="tunnel/warp-to-tunnel-route-ips" params={{ one: "SSH server" }} />

## 4. Add a target

<Render file="access/add-target" params={{ protocol: "generic" }} />

## 5. Add an infrastructure application

<Render file="access/add-infrastructure-app" />

## 6. (Recommended) Modify order of precedence in Gateway

<Render
	file="access/modify-gateway-policy-precedence"
	product="cloudflare-one"
	params={{ selector: "Access Infrastructure Target", protocol: "ssh" }}
/>

## 7. Configure SSH server

Next, configure your SSH server to trust the Cloudflare SSH CA. This allows Access to authenticate using short-lived certificates instead of traditional SSH keys.

### Generate a Cloudflare SSH CA

<Render file="ssh/ssh-proxy-ca-note" />

To generate a Cloudflare SSH CA and get its public key:

<Render file="ssh/ssh-proxy-ca" />

### Save the public key

<Render file="ssh/public-key" />

### Modify your `sshd_config` file

<Render file="ssh/modify-sshd" />

:::note
For certain distributions, such as Amazon Linux 1 (based on RHEL), the certificate file permissions must be set to `600`. You can set file permissions with the following command:

```sh
chmod 600 /etc/ssh/ca.pub
```

:::

### Restart your SSH server

<Render file="ssh/restart-server" />

## 8. Connect as a user

Users can use any SSH client to connect to the target, as long as they are logged into the WARP client on their device. If the target is located within a particular virtual network, ensure that the WARP client is [connected to that virtual network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/#connect-to-a-virtual-network) before initiating the connection. Users do not need to modify any SSH configs on their device. For example, to SSH from a terminal:

```sh
ssh <username>@<target IP>
```

Access for Infrastructure also supports `scp` and `rsync` commands. Refer to [Known limitations](#known-limitations) for a list of unsupported SSH commands and features.

To learn more about user connections, refer to the [Access for Infrastructure documentation](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/#4-connect-as-a-user).

## SSH command logs

SSH command logs contain the actual SSH commands that a user ran on the target. Customers on all plans can store SSH logs on Cloudflare and download the logs from the dashboard. [Downloadable logs](#download-encrypted-ssh-logs) are encrypted using a public key provided by the customer and are not visible to Cloudflare. Delivery of downloadable SSH logs is best effort; for guaranteed delivery, Enterprise customers can [configure a Logpush job](#export-ssh-logs-with-logpush) to send SSH logs to storage destinations. Logpush payloads are not encrypted with a customer-provided public key.

### Download encrypted SSH logs

Follow these instructions to encrypt and download SSH command logs from Zero Trust.

#### Enable SSH command logging

<Render file="ssh/upload-ssh-key" params={{ note: "" }} />

#### Disable SSH command logging

To turn off SSH command logging, delete your uploaded public key:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Network** > **SSH encryption public key**.

2. Select **Remove**.

3. Select **Remove key** to confirm.

Cloudflare will stop logging SSH commands to your targets, as well as any commands subject to [Gateway Audit SSH](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/ssh-logging/) policies.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="API">

To delete the SSH encryption public key using the [API](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/audit_ssh_settings/methods/update/):

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/gateway/audit_ssh_settings"
	method="PUT"
	json={{
		public_key: "",
	}}
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### View SSH logs

SSH command logs are not visible from the dashboard itself and must be exported and decrypted.

To manually retrieve logs:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Logs** > **Access**.
2. Filter the logs using the name of your [SSH application](#5-add-an-infrastructure-application).
3. Select the SSH session for which you want to export command logs.
4. In the side panel, scroll down to **SSH logs** and select **Download**.
5. <Render file="ssh/decrypt-ssh-log" />

### Export SSH logs with Logpush

:::note[Availability]
Only available on Enterprise plans.
:::

Cloudflare allows you to send SSH command logs to storage destinations configured in [Logpush](/logs/logpush/), including third-party destinations. For a list of available data fields, refer to the [SSH logs dataset](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/ssh_logs/).

To set up the Logpush job, refer to [Logpush integration](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/).

## Known limitations

### SSH features

The following SSH features are not supported:

- `sftp` commands
- `scp` commands that utilize OpenSSH versions > 9.0, because OpenSSH 9.0+ leverages `sftp` to execute the command
- Local and remote port forwarding
- SSH agent forwarding
- X11 forwarding

### Session duration

SSH sessions have a maximum expected duration of 10 hours. For more information, refer to the [Troubleshooting FAQ](/cloudflare-one/faq/troubleshooting/#long-lived-ssh-sessions-frequently-disconnect).
