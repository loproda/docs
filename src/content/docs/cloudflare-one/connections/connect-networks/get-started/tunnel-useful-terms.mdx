Review terminology for Cloudflare Tunnels.

## Tunnel

A tunnel is a secure, outbound-only pathway you can establish between your origin and Cloudflare's global network. Each tunnel you create will be assigned a [name](#tunnel-name) and a [UUID](#tunnel-uuid).

## Tunnel UUID

A tunnel UUID is an alphanumeric, unique ID assigned to a tunnel. The tunnel UUID can be used whenever you need to reference a specific tunnel.

## Tunnel name

A tunnel name is a unique, user-friendly identifier that you choose for a tunnel. Since a tunnel can proxy traffic to multiple services, tunnel names do not need to be hostnames. For example, you can assign your tunnel a name that represents your application/network, a particular server, or the cloud environment where it runs.

## Connector

The connector, referred to as `cloudflared`, establishes connectivity from your origin server to the Cloudflare global network. Our connector offers high availability by creating four long-lived connections to two distinct data centers within Cloudflare's global network. This built-in redundancy means that if an individual connection, server, or data center goes down, your origin remains available.

## Replica

You can create and configure a tunnel once and run that tunnel through multiple, unique instances of the connector, `cloudflared`. These instances are known as replicas. DNS records and Cloudflare Load Balancers will still point to the tunnel and its DNS Record (`UUID.cfargotunnel.com`), while that tunnel sends traffic to the multiple instances of `cloudflared` that run through it. Today, there is no guarantee about which replica will be chosen. Replicas are often deployed to provide tunnels with high availability in the event a given host running `cloudflared` is interrupted or taken offline.

## Remotely-managed tunnel

A remotely-managed tunnel is a [tunnel](#tunnel) that was created in [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) under **Networks** > **Tunnels**. Tunnel configuration is stored in Cloudflare, which allows you to manage the tunnel from the dashboard or using the [API](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/tunnels/subresources/configurations/methods/get/).

## Locally-managed tunnel

A locally-managed tunnel is a [tunnel](#tunnel) that was created by running `cloudflared tunnel create <NAME>` on the command line. Tunnel configuration is stored in your local [cloudflared directory](#default-cloudflared-directory). For terminology specific to locally-managed tunnels, refer to the [Locally-managed tunnel glossary](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/local-tunnel-terms/).

## Quick tunnels

Quick tunnels, when run, will generate a URL that consists of a random subdomain of the website `trycloudflare.com`, and point traffic to localhost on port `8080`. If you have a web service running at that address, users who visit the generated subdomain will be able to visit your web service through Cloudflare's network. Refer to [TryCloudflare](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/) for more information on how to run quick tunnels.

## Virtual networks

A [virtual network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/) is a software abstraction that allows you to logically segregate resources on your private network. Virtual networks are especially useful for exposing resources which have overlapping IP routes. To connect to a resource, end users would select a virtual network in their WARP client settings before entering the destination IP.
