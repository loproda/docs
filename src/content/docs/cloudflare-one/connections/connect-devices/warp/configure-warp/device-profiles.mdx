## Create a new profile

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
2. In the **Profile settings** card, select **Create profile**. This will make a copy of the **Default** profile.
3. Enter any name for the profile.
4. Create rules to define the devices that will use this profile. Learn more about the available [Selectors](#selectors), [Operators](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/#comparison-operators), and [Values](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/#value).
5. Configure [WARP settings](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#device-settings) for these devices.

:::note

At this time, **Split Tunnels** and **Local Domain Fallback** can only be modified after you save the profile.
:::

6. Select **Create profile**.

Your profile will appear in the **Profile settings** list. You can rearrange the profiles in the list according to your desired [order of precedence](#order-of-precedence).

1. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Zero Trust Write`

2. Create a new profile using the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_device_custom_profile`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_device_custom_profile) resource:

## Edit profile settings

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
2. In the **Profile settings** card, find the profile you want to update and select **Configure**.
3. Modify [WARP settings](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#device-settings) for this profile.
   :::note

   Changing any of the settings below will cause the WARP connection to restart. The user may experience a brief period of connectivity loss while the new settings are being applied.

   - [Service mode](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#service-mode)
   - [Local Domain Fallback](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#local-domain-fallback)
   - [Split Tunnels](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#split-tunnels)

   :::

4. Select **Save profile**.

 <Render file="warp/client-notification-lag" product="cloudflare-one" />

## Verify device profile

To check which device profile and profile settings are currently on a device, open a terminal and run:

```sh
warp-cli settings
```

The device profile UUID is shown in the `Profile ID` field.

Alternatively, if you do not have access to the CLI, you can use [DEX remote captures](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/remote-captures/) to generate a WARP diagnostic log. The `warp-settings.txt` log file will contain the output of `warp-cli settings`.

## Selectors

You can configure device profiles to match against the following selectors, or criteria. Identity-based selectors are only available if the user [enrolled the device](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/) by logging in to an identity provider (IdP).

### User email

Apply a device profile based on the user's email.

<Render file="gateway/selectors/user-email" params={{ UIname: "User email" }}/>

### User group emails

Apply a device profile based on an [IdP group](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/identity-selectors/#idp-groups-in-gateway) email address of which the user is configured as a member in the IdP.

<Render file="gateway/selectors/user-group-email" params={{ UIname: "User group emails" }}/>

### User group IDs

Apply a device profile based on an [IdP group](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/identity-selectors/#idp-groups-in-gateway) ID of which the user is configured as a member in the IdP.

<Render file="gateway/selectors/user-group-ids" params={{ UIname: "User group IDs" }}/>

### User group names

Apply a device profile based on an [IdP group](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/identity-selectors/#idp-groups-in-gateway) name of which the user is configured as a member in the IdP.

<Render file="gateway/selectors/user-group-names" params={{ UIname: "User group names" }}/>

### Operating system

Apply a device profile based on the operating system of the device.

| UI name         | API example                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Operating system | `os.name in {\"windows\" \"mac\"}` |

### Operating system version

Apply a device profile based on the [OS version](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/os-version/#determine-the-os-version) of the device.

| UI name         | API example                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Operating system version | `os.version == \"1.2.0\"` |

 <Render file="warp/os-version-semver" />

### Managed network

Apply a device profile based on the [managed network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/managed-networks/) that the device is connected to.

| UI name         | API example                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Managed network | `network == \"Austin office\"` |

### SAML attributes

Apply a device profile based on an attribute name and value from a [SAML IdP](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/identity-selectors/#generic-saml-idp).

<Render file="gateway/selectors/saml-attributes" />

### Service token

Apply a device profile based on the [service token](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/device-enrollment/#check-for-service-token) used to enroll the device.

| UI name         | API example                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Service Token | `identity.service_token_uuid == \"f174e90a-fafe-4643-bbbc-4a0ed4fc8415\"` |

## Comparison operators

Comparison operators determine how device profiles match a selector.

| Operator | Meaning                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| is       | equals the defined value                   |
| in       | matches at least one of the defined values |

## Logical operators

To evaluate multiple conditions in an expression, select a logical operator:

| Operator | Meaning                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| And      | match all of the conditions in the expression |
| Or       | match any of the conditions in the expression |

## Order of precedence

Profiles are evaluated from top to bottom as shown in the UI and follows the first match principle â€” once a device matches a profile, evaluation stops and no subsequent profiles can override the decision.

The **Default** profile is always at the bottom of the list, meaning that it will only apply if the device does not match any of the previous profiles. If you make another custom profile the default, all settings will be copied over into the **Default** profile.
