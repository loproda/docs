By default, Cloudflare Zero Trust excludes common top-level domains, used for local resolution, from being sent to Gateway for processing. These top-level domains are resolved by the local DNS resolver configured for the device on its primary interface.

You can add additional domains to the Local Domain Fallback list and specify a DNS server to use in place of the Gateway resolver. The WARP client proxies these requests directly to the configured fallback servers.

## Limitations

Local Domain Fallback only applies to devices running the WARP client.

Because DNS requests subject to Local Domain Fallback bypass the Gateway resolver, they are not subject to Gateway DNS policies or DNS logging. If you want to route DNS queries to custom resolvers and apply Gateway filtering, use [resolver policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/resolver-policies/). If both Local Domain Fallback and resolver policies are configured for the same device, Cloudflare will apply client-side Local Domain Fallback rules first.

## Manage local domains

### View domains

To view the domains subject to Local Domain Fallback:

<Render file="warp/view-local-domains" product="cloudflare-one" />

On this page, you will see a list of domains excluded from Gateway. You can [add](#add-a-domain) or [remove](#delete-a-domain) domains from the list at any time.

:::caution

Local Domain Fallback configuration only impacts where DNS requests get resolved, not the flow of traffic destined to those domains. If you want to prevent traffic from being sent to a specific domain or IP address, you must add those domains or IPs to your [Split Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/) configuration.

:::

### Add a domain

<Render file="warp/add-local-domain" product="cloudflare-one" />

### Delete a domain

<Render file="warp/view-local-domains" product="cloudflare-one" />

4. Find the domain in the list and select **Delete**.

The domain will no longer be excluded from Gateway DNS policies, effective immediately.
