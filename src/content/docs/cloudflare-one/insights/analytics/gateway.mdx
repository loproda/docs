To see the top Allowed and Blocked requests across all of your DNS locations, go to **Analytics** > **Gateway**. You can filter the data by selecting a specific location and/or time.

- **Requests** — This chart shows an overview of the number of requests made by end users within the time period you specify. It shows a breakdown of requests based on the decision Gateway took (either Allowed or Blocked).
- **Allowed requests** — This chart shows a breakdown of the five domains which received the highest number of Allowed requests. It also shows the five domains which received the lowest amount of Allowed requests. By selecting **View all** to the right of either section of the chart, you will see a list of highest 100 and lowest 100 domains ranked by number of Allowed requests.
- **Top blocked requests** — This chart shows a breakdown of the five domains which received the highest number of Blocked requests. It also shows the five domains which received the lowest number of Blocked requests. By selecting **View all** to the right of either section of the chart, you'll see a list of highest 100 and lowest 100 domains ranked by number of Blocked requests.
- **Requests by category** — The charts in this card show a breakdown of the **Top allowed categories** and the **Top blocked categories** based on the number of requests that Gateway classified as belonging to a content category.

## GraphQL queries

You can use the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/) to query your Gateway Analytics data. Available [datasets](/analytics/graphql-api/features/data-sets/) for Gateway include:

| Dataset                                                   | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gatewayL4DownstreamSessionsAdaptiveGroups`               | Metrics for Gateway network sessions from user devices to the Cloudflare global network.                                                 |
| `gatewayL4UpstreamSessionsAdaptiveGroups`                 | Metrics for Gateway network sessions from the Cloudflare global network to user devices.                                                 |
| `gatewayL4SessionsAdaptiveGroups`                         | Metrics for Gateway network sessions with adaptive sampling.                                                                             |
| `gatewayL7RequestsAdaptiveGroups`                         | Metrics for Gateway HTTP requests with adaptive sampling.                                                                                |
| `gatewayResolverQueriesAdaptiveGroups`                    | Metrics for Gateway DNS queries with adaptive sampling.                                                                                  |
| `gatewayResolverByRuleExecutionPerformanceAdaptiveGroups` | Time to execute Gateway DNS policies on the Cloudflare global network.                                                                   |
| `gatewayResolverByCustomResolverGroups`                   | Metrics for Gateway DNS queries resolved using custom resolvers.                                                                         |
| `gatewayResolverByCategoryAdaptiveGroups`                 | Metrics for Gateway DNS queries sorted by [domain category](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/domain-categories/) with adaptive sampling. |

To explore the schema, you can use a GraphQL client such as [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql#readme) or [Altair](https://altairgraphql.dev/).

1. [Create an API token](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/authentication/api-token-auth/) with the following permissions:

   | Type    | Item              | Permission |
   | ------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
   | Account | Account Analytics | Read       |

2. In your GraphQL client, [add your API token](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/authentication/graphql-client-headers/) as an Authorization header.
3. Compose a query to access your Gateway Analytics datasets. For example, you can query the `gatewayResolverQueriesAdaptiveGroups` dataset to return the adaptive groups of DNS queries resolved by Gateway:

   ```graphql graphql-api-explorer
   query GatewaySampleQuery($accountTag: string!, $start: Time) {
   	viewer {
   		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
   			gatewayResolverQueriesAdaptiveGroups(
   				filter: { datetime_gt: $start }
   				limit: 10
   			) {
   				count
   				dimensions {
   					queryNameReversed
   					resolverDecision
   				}
   			}
   		}
   	}
   }
   ```
