Email Security allows you to configure Logpush to send detection data to an endpoint of your choice.

## Enable detection logs

Detection logs generate logs made by Email Security and some of the metadata associated with the detection.

To enable detection logs, refer to [Enable destinations](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/).

If you enable detection logs using [R2](/r2/), choose **Email security alerts** when configuring the **Dataset**.

## Enable user action logs

User action logs allow you to view logs regarding all actions taken via the [API](/api/resources/email_security/) or the dashboard.

Before you can enable audit logs for Email Security, you will have to enable logpush jobs to your storage destination. Refer to [Enable destinations](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/) to enable logs on destinations such as Cloudflare R2, HTTP, Amazon S3, and more.

Once you have configured your destination, you can set up audit logs for user action:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Analytics & Logs** > **Logpush**.
3. Select **Audit logs**.
4. Under **Configure logpush job**:
  - **Job name**: Enter the job name.
  - **If logs match**: Select **Filtered logs**:
    - **Field**: Choose `ResourceType`.
    - **Operator**: Choose `starts with`.
    - **Value**: Enter `email_security`.
5. Select **Submit**.

You can now view logs via the Cloudflare dashboard.
