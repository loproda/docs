## Log retention

Cloudflare Zero Trust logs are stored for a varying period of time based on the service used and plan type:

| ----------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------ |
| **Admin logs**          | 18 months | 18 months | 18 months | 18 months | 18 months    |
| **Access logs**         | 24 hours  | 30 days   | 30 days   | 24 hours  | 180 days     |
| **DNS logs**            | 24 hours  | 30 days   | 24 hours  | 30 days   | 180 days[^1] |
