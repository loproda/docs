With Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX), you can test if your devices can connect to a private or public endpoint through the WARP client. Tests allow you to monitor availability for a given application and investigate performance issues reported by your end users.

DEX tests will only run when the WARP client is turned on, whereas [fleet status](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/monitoring/#fleet-status) metrics are always available.

To specify the target group of a test, use [DEX rules](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/rules/).
