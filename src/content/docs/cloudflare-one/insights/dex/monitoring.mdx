Monitor performance and network status for your organization's [fleet](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/monitoring/#fleet-status) or individual [user devices](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/monitoring/#device-monitoring).

Network and device performance data helps IT administrators troubleshoot performance issues, investigate network connectivity problems, and monitor device health.

## Fleet status

A fleet is a collection of user devices. All devices in a fleet have WARP installed and are connected to a [Cloudflare Zero Trust organization](/cloudflare-one/setup/#create-a-zero-trust-organization).

To view fleet status:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** > **Monitoring**.
2. In **DEX Monitoring**, review the information under the **Fleet Status** tab.

### View metrics

The **Fleet Status** tab will show real-time and historical connectivity metrics for all devices in your organization.

To view analytics on a per-device level, go to [Device monitoring](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/monitoring/#device-monitoring).

### Available metrics

- **Devices connected by colo**: Number of devices that are connected to a given [Cloudflare data center](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/).

- **Connectivity status**: Percentage of devices in a given WARP client state.

  | Status       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

  | Connected    | WARP has successfully established a connection to the Cloudflare global network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
  | Disconnected | WARP has been intentionally or unintentionally disconnected from the Cloudflare global network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
  | Paused       | A user or administrator has taken an explicit action to temporarily turn off WARP, for example by entering an [Admin Override](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#admin-override) code. Paused clients will [auto-connect](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#auto-connect) after a timeout period. |
  | Connecting   | WARP is pending connection, but is actively trying to establish a connection to the Cloudflare global network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

- **Mode**: [WARP mode](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/) deployed on the device.

- **Colo**: Percentage of devices connected to a given Cloudflare data center.

- **Platform**: Operating system of the device.

- **Major Version**: WARP client version installed on the device.

- **Device Status Over Time**: WARP client connection status over the selected time period.

- **Connection Methods Over Time**: WARP mode used by the device over the selected time period.

### Network and device performance metrics

#### Network performance metrics

- **Unique networks over time**: How many unique SSIDs the device was connected to.

- **Network I/O**: How much data has been transferred (uploads and downloads) over the primary network interface.

#### Device performance metrics

- **Battery percentage and cycles**: Displays battery percentage and [battery cycles](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102888) over time. Used to debug potential performance issues possibly related to battery health or power-saving measures that are triggered at low-battery levels.

- **CPU usage**: CPU utilization over time. Used to debug slow system performance due to high CPU usage.

- **Memory utilization**: Memory utilization over time. Used to debug performance issues related to an overtaxed memory.

- **Disk I/O**: Displays number of disk read/write operations over time. Used to debug performance errors due to heavy disk operations.
