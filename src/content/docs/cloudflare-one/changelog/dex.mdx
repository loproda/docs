## 2025-01-24

**IP visibility**

[IP visibility](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/ip-visibility/) enables admins to inspect the different IP addresses associated with an end-user device. IP types available for review on the Cloudflare dashboard include: the device's private IP, the public IP assigned to the device by the ISP, and the router's (that the device is connected to) private IP.

## 2024-12-19

**Remote captures**

Admins can now collect packet captures (PCAPs) and WARP diagnostic logs from end-user devices. For more information, refer to [Remote captures](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/remote-captures/).

## 2024-05-20

**Last seen ISP**

Admins can view the last ISP seen for a device by going to **My Team** > **Devices**. Requires setting up a [traceroute test](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/traceroute/).

## 2024-05-13

**DEX alerts**

Admins can now set [DEX alerts](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/notifications/) using [Cloudflare Notifications](/notifications/). Three new DEX alert types:

- Device connectivity anomaly
- Test latency
- Test low availability
