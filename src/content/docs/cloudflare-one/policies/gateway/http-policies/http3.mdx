Gateway supports inspection of HTTP/3 traffic, which uses the QUIC protocol over UDP. HTTP/3 inspection requires a [user-side certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/user-side-certificates/) to be deployed and traffic to be proxied over UDP with [TLS version 1.3](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/).

Gateway applies HTTP policies to HTTP/3 traffic last. For more information, refer to the [order of enforcement](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/order-of-enforcement/#http3-traffic).

## Enable HTTP/3 inspection

To enable HTTP/3 inspection, turn on the [Gateway proxy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/proxy/) for UDP:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Network**.
2. In **Firewall**, turn on **Proxy**.
3. Select **TCP** and **UDP**.
4. Turn on **TLS decryption**.

### Application limitations

Gateway can inspect HTTP/3 traffic from Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge by establishing an HTTP/3 proxy connection. Gateway will then terminate the HTTP/3 connection, decrypt and inspect the traffic, and connect to the destination server over HTTP/2. Gateway can also inspect other HTTP applications, such as cURL.

If the UDP proxy is turned on in Zero Trust, Google Chrome will cancel all HTTP/3 connections and retry them with HTTP/2, allowing you to enforce your HTTP policies. If the UDP proxy is turned off, HTTP/3 traffic from Chrome will bypass inspection.

## Force HTTP/2 traffic

To apply Gateway policies to HTTP traffic without turning on the UDP proxy, you must turn off QUIC in your users' browsers to ensure only HTTP/2 traffic reaches Gateway.

<Details header="Google Chrome">

1. Go to `chrome://flags`
2. Set **Experimental QUIC protocol** to _Disabled_.
3. Relaunch Chrome.

</Details>

<Details header="Safari">

You cannot turn off QUIC in Safari. All traffic will be sent over HTTP/3.

</Details>

<Details header="Firefox">

1. Go to `about:config`.
2. If you receive a warning, select **Accept the Risk and Continue**.
3. Set **network.http.http3.enable** to _false_.
4. Relaunch Firefox.

</Details>

<Details header="Microsoft Edge">

1. Go to `edge://flags`
2. Set **Experimental QUIC protocol** to _Disabled_.
3. Relaunch Edge.
