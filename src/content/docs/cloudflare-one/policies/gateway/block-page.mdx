When Gateway blocks traffic with a [DNS](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/#block) or [HTTP Block policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#block), you can configure a block page to display in your users' browsers. You can provide a descriptive reason for blocking traffic and contact information, or you can redirect your users' browsers to another page. You can apply these customizations globally for every Block policy, or override the settings on a per-policy basis.

## Prerequisites

In order to display the block page as the URL of the blocked domain, your organization's devices must have a [Cloudflare certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/user-side-certificates/manual-deployment/) installed. Enterprise users can also [deploy their own root CA certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/user-side-certificates/custom-certificate/). If you do not install a certificate, the block page [will not display correctly](#certificate-error).

## Configure the block page

Gateway will display a global block page in the browser of any user whose traffic is blocked. By default, Gateway will display the block page for any DNS Block policies you turn it on for and all HTTP Block policies. You can [turn on or override the global setting](#configure-policy-block-behavior) on a per-policy basis.

To configure the global block page:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.
2. Under **Account Gateway block page**, Gateway will display the current block page setting. Select **Customize**.
3. Choose whether to use the [default Gateway block page](#use-the-default-block-page), a [URL redirect](#redirect-to-a-block-page), or a [custom Gateway block page](#customize-the-block-page).
4. Select **Save**.

### Use the default block page

When you choose **Default Gateway block page**, Gateway will display a [block page hosted by Cloudflare](https://blocked.teams.cloudflare.com/). This is the default option for all traffic blocked by Gateway.

### Redirect to a block page

Instead of displaying the Cloudflare block page, you can configure Gateway to return a `307` (Temporary Redirect) HTTP response code and redirect to a custom URL.

To redirect users to a non-Cloudflare block page:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.
2. Under **Account Gateway block page**, select **Customize**.
3. Choose **URL redirect**
4. Enter the URL you want to redirect blocked traffic to.
5. (Optional) Turn on **Send policy context** to send [additional policy context](#policy-context) to the redirected URL.
6. Select **Save**.

Gateway will now redirect users to a custom page when user traffic matches a Block policy with the block page configured.

To create an HTTP policy to redirect URLs, refer to the [Redirect action](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#redirect).

#### Policy context

<Render file="gateway/policy-context" />

#### Redirect precedence

Paths and queries in the redirect URL take precedence over the original URL. When you turn on **Send policy context**, Gateway will append context to the end of the redirected URL. For example, if the original URL is `example.com/path/to/page?querystring=X&k=1` and the redirect URL is `cloudflare.com/redirect-path?querystring=Y`, Gateway will redirect requests to:

```txt ins="&cf_user_email=user@example.com"
cloudflare.com/redirect-path?querystring=Y&cf_user_email=user@example.com
```

### Customize the block page

<Render file="gateway/customize-block-page" />

#### Add a logo image

<Render file="gateway/add-logo-image" />

#### Allow users to email an administrator

You can add a Mailto link to your custom block page, which allows users to directly email you about the blocked site. When users select **Contact your Administrator** on your block page, an email template opens with the email address and subject line you configure, as well as the following diagnostic information:

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Rule ID      | The ID of the Gateway policy that blocked the page.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Source IP    | The public source IP of the user device.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Account ID   | The Cloudflare account associated with the block policy.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| User ID      | The ID of the user who visited the page. Currently, User IDs are not surfaced in the dashboard and can only be viewed by calling the [API](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/access/subresources/users/methods/list/). |
| Device ID    | The ID of the device that visited the page. This is generated by the WARP client.                                                                                                                                           |
| Block Reason | Your policy-specific block message.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Configure policy block behavior

For DNS Block policies, you will need to turn on the block page for each policy you want to display it. For HTTP Block policies, Gateway automatically displays your global block page setting by default. You can override your global block page setting for both policy types within each policy's settings.

To turn on the block page or override your global block page setting for an individual policy:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="DNS policy">

<Render
	file="gateway/add-block-page"
	params={{
		firewallPolicyPath: "**Gateway** > **Firewall policies** > **DNS**",
		blockBehaviorAction: "turn on",
	}}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="HTTP policy">

<Render
	file="gateway/add-block-page"
	params={{
		firewallPolicyPath: "**Gateway** > **Firewall policies** > **HTTP**",
		blockBehaviorAction: "go to",
	}}
/>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Limitations

### Certificate error

If your users receive a security risk warning in their browser when visiting a blocked page, check that you have correctly [installed a certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/user-side-certificates/manual-deployment/) on their devices. If a certificate is not installed or the installed certificate is invalid or expired, your user's browser may:

- Display an **HTTP Response Code: 526** error page, indicating an insecure upstream.
- Close the connection and fail to display any pages.

For more information on fixing certificate issues, refer to [Troubleshooting](/cloudflare-one/faq/troubleshooting/#as-of-february-2-2025-my-end-user-devices-browser-is-returning-a-your-connection-is-not-private-warning).

### Incompatible DNS record types

<Render file="gateway/block-page-dns-records" product="cloudflare-one" />

### Third-party filtering conflict

<Render file="gateway/third-party-warning" />

### Data center and IP address matching

If an HTTP request that matches a block policy does not arrive at the same Cloudflare data center as its DNS query, Gateway will display the default block page instead of your custom block page.

This applies to DNS queries sent to any Gateway resolver endpoint, including those over IPv4, IPv6, and encrypted protocols like DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS). If a DNS query is routed to a different Cloudflare data center than the corresponding HTTP request (for example, if DoH traffic is sent outside the WARP tunnel), Gateway cannot correlate the two requests and will display the default block page instead of your custom block page.

If the HTTP request comes from a different IP address than the DNS request, Gateway may not display the rule ID, custom message, or other fields on the block page. This can happen when a recursive DNS resolver's source IP address differs from the user device's IP address.
