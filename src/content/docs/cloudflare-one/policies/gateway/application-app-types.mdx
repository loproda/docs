Gateway allows you to create DNS, Network, and HTTP policies based on applications and app types. You can select individual applications or groups of app types to filter specific traffic on your network.

## Applications

When you choose the _Application_ selector in a Gateway policy builder, the **Value** field will include all supported applications and their respective app types. Alternatively, you can use the [Gateway API](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/app_types/methods/list/) to fetch a list of applications, app types, and ID numbers.

## App types

Gateway sorts applications into the following app type groups:

| Value                                          | Definition                                                                                                                  |

## Usage

### Overlapping hostnames

Overlapping hostnames are most common for vendors with many applications, such as Google or Meta. When you use the Application selector in Gateway policies, actions taken by Gateway will be limited to the specific application defined. Gateway will also log other applications that use the same hostnames, but it will not take action unless the application was matched by the policy. For example, both the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps use the `chat-e2ee.facebook.com` hostname. When evaluating traffic to the Facebook Messenger app, Gateway will only take action on Facebook Messenger traffic but may log both the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps.

To ensure Gateway evaluates traffic with your desired precedence, order your most specific policies with the highest priority according to [order of precedence](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/order-of-enforcement/#priority-within-a-policy-builder).

### Do Not Inspect applications

Gateway automatically groups applications incompatible with TLS decryption into the _Do Not Inspect_ app type. As Cloudflare identifies incompatible applications, Gateway will periodically update this app type to add new applications. To ensure Gateway does not intercept any current or future incompatible traffic, you can [create a Do Not Inspect HTTP policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) with the entire _Do Not Inspect_ app type selected.

:::note[Install Cloudflare certificate manually to allow TLS decryption]

Instead of creating a Do Not Inspect policy for an application, you may be able to configure the application to [trust a Cloudflare certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/user-side-certificates/manual-deployment/#add-the-certificate-to-applications). Doing so will allow the application to function without losing visibility into your traffic.
:::

#### TLS decryption limitations

Applications can be incompatible with [TLS decryption](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/) for various reasons:

- <GlossaryDefinition
  	term="certificate pinning"
  	prepend="**Certificate pinning**: Certificate pinning is "
  />

- **Non-web traffic**: Some applications send non-web traffic, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), over TLS. Gateway cannot inspect these protocols.

#### Microsoft 365 integration

To optimize performance for Microsoft 365 applications and services, you can bypass TLS decryption by turning on the Microsoft 365 traffic integration. This will create a [Do Not Inspect policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) for all [Microsoft 365 domains and IP addresses](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-ip-web-service) specified by Microsoft. This policy also uses Cloudflare intelligence to identify other Microsoft 365 traffic not explicitly defined.

To turn on the Microsoft 365 integration:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Network** > **Integrated experiences**.
2. In **Bypass decryption of Microsoft 365 traffic**, select **Create policy**.
3. To verify the policy was created, select **View policy**. Alternatively, go to **Gateway** > **Firewall policies** > **HTTP**. A policy named Microsoft 365 Auto Generated will be enabled in your list.

All future Microsoft 365 traffic will bypass Gateway logging and filtering. To disable this behavior, turn off or delete the policy.

### Terraform

Terraform users can retrieve the app types list with the `cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_app_types_list` data source. This allows you to create Gateway policies with the application's name rather than its numeric ID. For example:

```tf
data "cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_app_types_list" "gateway_apptypes" {
  account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
}

locals {
  apptypes_map = merge([
    for c in data.cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_app_types_list.gateway_apptypes.result :
    { (c.name) = c.id }
  ]...)
}

resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_gateway_policy" "zt_block_dns_apps" {
  account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
  name       = "DNS Blocked apps"
  action     = "block"
  traffic    = "any(app.ids[*] in {${join(" ", [
    local.apptypes_map["Discord"],
    local.apptypes_map["GoToMeeting"],
    local.apptypes_map["Greenhouse"],
    local.apptypes_map["Zelle"],
    local.apptypes_map["Microsoft Visual Studio"]
  ])}})"
}
```
