Browser Isolation offers features to support users who have visual impairments or non-English language requirements.

## Screen reader

The isolated browser has a built-in screen reader which speaks out loud the content of the isolated page.

### Turn the screen reader on or off

To turn the built-in screen reader on or off, right-click on any isolated page and select **Accessibility** > **Enable** / **Disable screen reader**.

Alternatively, to use a keyboard shortcut, press `CTRL + ALT + Z`.

## Languages

The isolated browser supports keyboard inputs in all languages. Users can use their native keyboard to type in languages that use diacritics (for example, `รก` or`รง`) or character-based scripts (for example, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean).
