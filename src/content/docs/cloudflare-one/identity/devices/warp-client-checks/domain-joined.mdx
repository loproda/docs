The Domain Joined device posture attribute ensures that a user is a member of a specific Windows Active Directory domain.

## Prerequisites

- <Render
  	file="posture/prereqs-warp-is-deployed"
  	params={{
  		name: "WARP Client Checks",
  		link: "/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/",
  	}}
  />

## Enable the Domain Joined check

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
2. Scroll down to **WARP client checks** and select **Add new**.
3. Select **Domain Joined**.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the check.
5. Select your operating system.
6. Enter the domain you want to check for, such as `example.com`.
    :::note
    The **Domain** field is case-sensitive. If your domain is `example.com`, entering `Example.com` will fail the posture check.
    :::
7. Select **Save**.

Next, go to **Logs** > **Posture** and verify that the Domain Joined check is returning the expected results.

## Validate the domain value

To check the domain value on your Windows device:

1. Open a PowerShell window.
2. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   (Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain
   ```

The command will return the Active Directory domain to which your device belongs.
