## Prerequisites

Device posture with Crowdstrike requires:

* Falcon Enterprise plan or above
* Crowdstrike agent is deployed on the device.
* <Render file="posture/prereqs-warp-is-deployed" params={{ name: "Service providers", link: "/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/service-providers/" }} />

## Set up CrowdStrike as a service provider

### 1. Obtain CrowdStrike settings

The following CrowdStrike values are needed to set up the CrowdStrike posture check:

To retrieve those values:

1. Log in to your Falcon Dashboard.
2. Go to **Support and resources** > **API Clients and Keys**.
3. Select **Create API client** and enter any name for the client.
4. Turn on the following API permissions:
	| Scope | Permission |
	| ----- | ---------- |
	| Detections | Read |
	| Hosts      | Read |
	| Event Streams | Read |
	| User Management | Read |
	| Zero Trust Assessment | Read |
5. Select **Create**.
6. Copy the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Base URL** to a safe place.
7. Go to **Host setup and management** > **Sensor downloads** and copy your **Customer ID**.

### 2. Add CrowdStrike as a service provider

<Render file="posture/add-service-provider" params={{ provider: "Crowdstrike" }} />
5. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client secret** you noted down above.
6. In **Rest API URL**, enter your **Base URL**.
7. Enter your **Customer ID**.
8. Choose a **Polling frequency** for how often Cloudflare Zero Trust should query CrowdStrike for information.
9. Select **Test and save**.

### 3. Configure the posture check

<Render file="posture/configure-posture-check" params={{ one: "Crowdstrike" }} />
