With Email Security, you can use different screen criteria to search through your email, reclassify and move a certain volume of messages, find similar emails, and export messages.

## Screen criteria

Email Security allows you to use popular, regular, and advanced screening criteria to search through your inbox. Advanced screening will give you the most in-depth investigation of your inbox.

2. Select **Email Security**.
3. Select **Investigation**, then **Run new screen**.
4. Choose between **Popular**, **Regular**, and **Advanced** screen methods. Refer to the explanation below to learn what each method does.

The results will be displayed on a table. The table allows you to review and take action on the messages that match your chosen screening criteria.

### Popular screen

A popular screen allows you to view messages based on common pre-defined criteria.

2. On the **Investigation** page, under **Your matching messages**, select the message you want to reclassify.
3. Select the three dots, then select **Request reclassification**.
4. Under **New disposition**, select among the following:
   - **Malicious**: Traffic invoked multiple phishing verdict triggers, met thresholds for bad behavior, and is associated with active campaigns.

   - **Spam**: Traffic associated with non-malicious, commercial campaigns.
   - **Bulk**: Traffic associated with [Graymail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graymail_%28email%29), that falls in between the definitions of `SPAM` and `SUSPICIOUS`. For example, a marketing email that intentionally obscures its unsubscribe link.
   - **Clean**: Traffic not associated with any phishing campaigns.
5. Select **Save**.

To reclassify messages in bulk, select **Select all messages** > **Action** > **Request reclassification**.
