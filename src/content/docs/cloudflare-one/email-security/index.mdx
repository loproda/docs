<Description>Protect your email inbox with Email Security.</Description>

Email Security protects your email inbox from phishing attacks, malware, [Business Email Compromise](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) attacks, and vendor email fraud.

Email Security integrates with your existing email provider (such as Microsoft 365 or Gmail), and reduces the amount of spam and phishing emails landing in your inbox. You can configure Email Security via [API deployment](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/), [BCC](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/)/[Journaling](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/journaling-setup/m365-journaling/), or [MX/Inline](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment-setup/). All three deployments aim at protecting your organization for malicious activities.

The Cloudflare dashboard will display the Email Security overview page only after completing the [setup process](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/).
