For customers using Gmail as their email provider, setting up Email Security is quick and easy.

You will need to [create an integration](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/enable-gmail-integration/), [add BCC rules](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/add-bcc-rules/), and [connect your domain(s)](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/connect-domains/). You can choose to [add additional domains](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/connect-domains/#add-additional-domains) at a later stage.

Once you set up Google integration, Email Security will receive a copy of your email messages. You will need a Google integration to enable [auto-moves](/cloudflare-one/email-security/auto-moves/).

The following email flow shows how this works:
