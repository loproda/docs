When you receive an email, the email lands on your Microsoft 365 inbox, and then Email Security receives a copy of that email. The following email flow shows how this works:

To enable Microsoft 365 journaling deployment:

2. Select **Overview**. If you have not purchased Email Security, select **Contact Sales**. Otherwise, select **Set up** > **BCC/Journaling**.
3. Select **Integrate with MS** > **Authorize**.
4. Continue with [Integrate with Microsoft 365](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/journaling-setup/m365-journaling/#integrate-with-microsoft-365) to connect your Microsoft integration.

## Integrate with Microsoft 365

To integrate with Microsoft 365:

1. **Name integration**: Add your integration name, then select **Continue**.
2. **Authorize integration**:
   - Select **Authorize**. Selecting **Authorize** will take you to the **Microsoft Sign in** page where you will have to enter your email address.
   - Once you enter your email address, select **Next**.
   - After selecting **Next**, the dashboard will show you a dialog box with a list of requested permissions. Select **Accept to authorize Email Security**. Upon authorization, you will be redirected to a page where you can review details and enroll the integration.
3. **Review details**: Review your integration details, then:
   - Select **Complete Email Security set up** where you will be able to connect your domains and configure auto-moves.
   - Select **Continue to Email Security**.

Continue with [Connect your domains](#connect-your-domains) for the next steps.

5. **Configure service address with your third party email provider**: Copy and paste the service address into your third-party email provider to allow BCC/Journaling: `<account tag>@CF-emailsecurity.com`.
6. **Review details**: Review your connected domains. Then, select **Go to domains.**

Your domains are now added successfully.
