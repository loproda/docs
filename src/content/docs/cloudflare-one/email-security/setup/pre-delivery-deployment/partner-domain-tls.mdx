To add additional TLS (Transport Layer Security) requirements for emails coming from certain domains, you can enforce higher levels of SSL/TLS inspection. If TLS is required, mail without TLS from the specified domain will be dropped.

:::note
To enforce TLS across all emails, you will need to enforce TLS requirements when you are onboarding your domain. To only enforce TLS for specific emails, you can do so by going to **Settings** > **Partner domain TLS** > **Add a domain**.
