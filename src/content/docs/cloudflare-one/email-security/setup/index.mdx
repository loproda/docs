Before you start the onboarding process, you will have to:

1. Choose a deployment path: Email Security provides two deployment modes, [post-delivery](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/) for API and BCC/Journaling and [pre-delivery](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/) for MX/Inline.
2. Learn about dispositions, impersonation registry, and reclassifications.
3. Know the steps to configure your email environment correctly.

## 1. Choose a deployment

### Post-delivery deployment

When you choose post-delivery deployment, Cloudflare scans emails **after** they reach a users' inbox.

If you are a Microsoft 365 user, this is done via [Microsoft's Graph API](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/m365-api/) or [journaling](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/journaling-setup/m365-journaling/).

If you are a [Google Workspace](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/) or [Microsoft Exchange](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/bcc-microsoft-exchange/) user, this is done via BCC.

#### Why you should consider post-delivery deployment

Post-delivery deployment is time-efficient, because it does not involve MX changes. Post-delivery deployment does not disrupt mail flow. Post-delivery deployment allows you to enable [auto-move events](/cloudflare-one/email-security/auto-moves/) to hard or soft delete messages, and synchronize your [directory](/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/) when you use Microsoft Graph API or Google Workspace.

:::note
When you choose post-delivery deployment:
- The threat is removed **after** the message has been delivered to the inbox.
- It requires API scopes, or BCC/Journaling rule configuration.
- Auto-move is only available in BCC/Journaling if you associate an integration.
:::

### Pre-delivery deployment

When you choose pre-delivery deployment, Cloudflare scans emails **before** they reach a users' inbox. The MX record points to Cloudflare.

#### Why you should consider pre-delivery deployment

Pre-delivery deployment provides you with the highest level of protection. It enforces [text add-ons](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/configure-text-add-ons/) or link rewrite at delivery.

Pre-delivery blocks threats in transit, and it adds banners or texts before the user views the email.

:::note
When you choose pre-delivery deployment:
- You must edit MX records or create a connector.
- You can enable auto-move events only after you associate an integration.
- Cloudflare [egress IPs](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/egress-ips/) are allowed on downstream mail servers.

## 2. Understand dispositions

Dispositions allow you to configure policies and tune reporting. For example, you can configure a policy to move suspicious emails to your junk folder.

Refer to [Dispositions](/cloudflare-one/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/#dispositions) to learn more about dispositions.

## 3. Set up the impersonation registry

Most [business email compromise (BEC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) targets executives or finance roles. You must add addresses of roles who are likely to be impersonated. Refer to [Impersonation registry](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/impersonation-registry/) to learn how to add a user to the impersonation registry.

Roles you may want to include in the impersonation registry are:

- C-suites
- Finance roles
- HR
- IT help-desk
- Legal

You should review your impersonation registry on a quarterly basis as roles change.

## 4. Reclassify messages

A reclassification is a change to an email's disposition **after** initial scanning. It is Cloudflare's built-in feedback loop for correcting false positives/negatives **and** training the detection models to get smarter over time. Refer to [Reclassify messages](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#reclassify-messages) to learn how to reclassify a message.


### Who can reclassify messages

[Security teams](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#team-submissions) and [end users](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#user-submissions) can submit a reclassification. 

### Why you should reclassify messages

Reclassifications are critical because:

- **They help improve model accuracy**: Every validated reclassification teaches Cloudflare's machine learning to recognise new lures, language, infrastructure, and benign patterns.
- **They reduce alert fatigue**: Correcting Suspicious or Spam emails that users actually want tailors detections to your organization, cutting noise in the dashboard.
- **They close the remediation loop**: When a disposition is upgraded to Malicious, Cloudflare auto-moves those emails out of every inbox (Graph API or Google Workspace API integrations).
- **They can help you log activity taken on any reclassification**: Each reclassification displays a submission ID, details about original, requested and final dispositions, and more. Refer to [Reclassify messages](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#reclassify-messages) to learn more about reclassifications.

To make the most of reclassifications:

1. Review reclassifications on a weekly basis.
2. Ensure you have an integration associated with any MX/Inline deployment. When you associate an integration, you will not need to upload the EMLs every time; Cloudflare can use APIs to receive a copy of your email messages.
3. Investigate any increase in [user submissions](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#user-submissions) (users may have found a phish that bypassed filters) and confirm that analyst-final dispositions align with your policies.

A correct use of reclassifications ensures that Email Security delivers a stronger protection with less manual tuning.

## 5. Configuration checklist

Now that you know which deployment path to choose, you can begin your onboarding process.
