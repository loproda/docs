As part of your continuous email security posture, administrators and security analysts need to submit missed <GlossaryTooltip term="phishing">phishing</GlossaryTooltip> samples to Email Security, so Cloudflare can process them and take necessary action.

Submitting missed phish samples to Cloudflare is of paramount importance and necessary for continuous protection. Submitting missed phish samples helps Cloudflare improve our machine learning (ML) models, and alerts us of new attack vectors before they become prevalent.

There are three routes you can use to report an email as a phish:

- Via Investigation, by [reclassifying an email](/cloudflare-one/email-security/phish-submissions/#reclassify-an-email).
- Via [PhishNet M365](/cloudflare-one/email-security/phish-submissions/#phishnet-m365) or [PhishNet for Google Workspace](/cloudflare-one/email-security/phish-submissions/#phishnet-for-google-workspace), depending on your email provider.
- Via [Submission addresses](/cloudflare-one/email-security/phish-submissions/#submission-addresses).

## Reclassify an email

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email Security** > **Investigation**.
3. On the **Investigation** page, under **Your matching messages**, select the message you want to reclassify. Select the three dots, then select **Request reclassification**. By selecting **Request reclassification**, you are requesting a new disposition for the message.
4. Select the new disposition, then select **Save**. 

When you report an email as phish, this email will be displayed under [User submissions](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#user-submissions).
## PhishNet M365

PhishNet is an add-in button that helps users to submit directly to Email Security <GlossaryTooltip term="phishing">phish</GlossaryTooltip> samples missed by Email Security's detection.

To set up PhishNet M365:

1. Get the customized manifest URL from [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/email-security/settings/email-policy/phish-submission?tab=phish-submission).
2. Log in to the [Microsoft admin panel](https://admin.microsoft.com/). 
3. Go to **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Settings** > **Integrated Apps**.
4. Select **Upload custom apps**.
5. Choose **Provide link to manifest file** and paste the URL you copied from the Zero Trust dashboard.
6. Verify and complete the wizard.

## PhishNet for Google Workspace

3. You will be redirected to the **Allow data access** page, where you can choose to install Cloudflare PhishNet for **Everyone at your organization**, or **Certain groups or organizational units**. If you choose the latter option, you will have to select the users in the next step.
