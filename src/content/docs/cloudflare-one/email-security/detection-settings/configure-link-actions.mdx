You can configure how Email Security handles links in emails.

:::note
You can only configure link actions if you deploy Email Security via [MX/Inline](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/pre-delivery-deployment/mx-inline-deployment/).
:::

To configure link actions:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email Security**.
3. Select **Settings**, then go to **Detection settings** > **Link actions** > **View**.
4. Select **Configure**:
    - **Email link isolation (Recommended)**: This option allows Email Security to open all suspicious links in an isolated browser environment. This option is on by default.
    - **Assign actions based on dispositions**: Review the [disposition types](/cloudflare-one/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/#dispositions) and select link actions (choose between **URL defang** to allow links to be unclickable, or **No action** for no action to be taken on the link).
5. Select **Save**.

## Add patterns for URLs

You can add patterns for URLs that should be rewritten.

1. Under **URL rewrite ignore patterns**, select **Add a pattern**.
2. Enter a valid IP, URL, or regular expression. You can enter up to 512 characters.
3. Select **Save**.

To edit a pattern, go to the pattern you want to edit, select the three dots, then **Edit**. Once you have finished modifying the URL patter, select **Save**.

To delete a pattern, go to the pattern you want to delete, select the three dots, then **Delete**.
