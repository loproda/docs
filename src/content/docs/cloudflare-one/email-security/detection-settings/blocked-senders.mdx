Email Security marks all messages from these senders with a malicious [disposition](/cloudflare-one/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/).

## How blocked senders work

Blocked senders ensures messages from any sender is automatically marked as malicious, preventing them from reaching users' inbox.

Sometimes, the same email, IP address or domain always sends malicious emails to the company. In this case, you can add an email address, IP address or domain as a blocked sender. You can choose to enter a regular expression by turning **Regular expression** on.
