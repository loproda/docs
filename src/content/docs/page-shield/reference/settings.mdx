## Reporting endpoint

When enabled, Page Shield's client-side resource monitoring uses a <GlossaryTooltip term="content security policy (CSP)">Content Security Policy (CSP)</GlossaryTooltip> [report-only HTTP header](/page-shield/reference/csp-header/) to gather information about all the scripts running on your application.

By default, reports are sent to a Cloudflare-owned endpoint:

```txt
https://csp-reporting.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/script_monitor/report?<QUERY_STRING>
```

Enterprise customers with a paid add-on can change the reporting endpoint so that the CSP reports are sent to the same hostname:

```txt
<YOUR-HOSTNAME>/cdn-cgi/script-monitor/report?<QUERY_STRING>
```

### Prerequisites for using the same hostname for CSP reports

Using the same hostname for CSP reporting may interfere with other Cloudflare products. Before selecting this option, ensure that your Cloudflare configuration complies with the following:

- No rate limiting rules match the `cdn-cgi/*` URL path
- No custom rules match the `cdn-cgi/*` URL path

### Configure the reporting endpoint

To configure the CSP reporting endpoint:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

2. Go to **Security** > **Page Shield** > **Settings**.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Connection target details

When connection targets are reported to Cloudflare, their URIs can sometimes include sensitive data such as session ID.

By default, Page Shield will only check the domain against malicious threat intelligence feeds. You can choose to let Page Shield use the full URI when analyzing the connections made from your domain's pages. Any sensitive data present in the URI will be logged in clear text, and any user with access to the connection monitor dashboard will be able to view it.

### Configure the connection target details to use

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Page Shield** > **Settings**.
3. Under **Connection target details**, select **Log host only** to analyze only the hostname or **Log full URI** to use the full URI in Page Shield.
4. Select **Apply settings**.

Turning off Page Shield's client-side resource monitoring will not turn off [policies](/page-shield/policies/) (also known as content security rules). To turn off policies:

- Old dashboard: Go to **Security** > **Page Shield** > **Policies**.
- New security dashboard: Go to **Security** > **Security rules** and filter by `Content security rules`.
