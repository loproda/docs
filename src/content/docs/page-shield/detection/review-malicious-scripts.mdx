Cloudflare displays scripts and connections considered malicious at the top of the dashboard lists, so that you can quickly identify those resources, review them, and take action.

## Review malicious scripts

To review the scripts considered malicious:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to the client-side resources page:
   - Old dashboard: Go to **Security** > **Page Shield**.
   - New security dashboard: Go to **Security** > **Web assets** > **Client-side resources** tab.

3. Select the **Scripts** tab.

4. Select **Details** for each script considered malicious. The script details will contain:
   - **Malicious code analysis**: Scores between 1-99 classifying how malicious the current script version is, where 1 means definitely malicious and 99 means definitely not malicious.
   - **Code behavior analysis**: Scores classifying the behavior of the current script version in terms of code obfuscation and data exfiltration. The scores vary between 1-99, where 1 means definitely malicious and 99 means definitely not malicious.
   - **Threat intelligence**: Whether the script URL and/or domain is known to be malicious according to threat intelligence feeds. If the script is considered malicious according to the feeds, the dashboard will show a list of associated threat [categories](/page-shield/how-it-works/malicious-script-detection/#malicious-script-and-connection-categories). If threat intelligence feeds do not have any information about the script URL or domain, the dashboard will show **Not present**.

   The script details also include the last 10 script versions detected by Cloudflare.

   For more information, refer to [Malicious script and connection detection](/page-shield/how-it-works/malicious-script-detection/).

5. Based on the displayed information, and with the help of the [last seen/first seen fields in the script details](/page-shield/detection/monitor-connections-scripts/#view-details), review and update the pages where the malicious script was detected.

You can configure alerts for detected malicious scripts. Refer to [Alerts](/page-shield/alerts/) for more information.

## Review malicious connections

To review the connections considered malicious:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to the client-side resources page:
   - Old dashboard: Go to **Security** > **Page Shield**.
   - New security dashboard: Go to **Security** > **Web assets** > **Client-side resources** tab.

3. Select **Connections**.

4. Select **Details** for each connection considered malicious. The connection details will contain:
   - **URL match**: Whether the connection's target URL is known to be malicious according to threat intelligence feeds. This field requires that you configure Page Shield to analyze the [full URI](/page-shield/reference/settings/#connection-target-details) of outgoing connections.
   - **Domain match**: Whether the connection's target domain is known to be malicious according to threat intelligence feeds.
   - **Category**: The categorization of the connection considered malicious according to threat intelligence feeds.

   For more information, refer to [Malicious script and connection detection](/page-shield/how-it-works/malicious-script-detection/).

5. Based on the displayed information, and with the help of the [last seen/first seen fields in the connection details](/page-shield/detection/monitor-connections-scripts/#view-details), review and update the pages where the malicious connection was detected.
