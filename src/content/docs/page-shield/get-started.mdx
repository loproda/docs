import { Tabs, TabItem, Render } from "~/components";

## Activate client-side resource monitoring

To enable client-side resource monitoring:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Page Shield**.
3. Select **Enable Page Shield**.

If you do not have access to Page Shield in the Cloudflare dashboard, check if your user has one of the [necessary roles](/page-shield/reference/roles-and-permissions/).

</TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Settings** and filter by **Client-side abuse**.
3. Turn on **Continuous script monitoring**.

If you do not have access to resource monitoring in the Cloudflare dashboard, check if your user has one of the [necessary roles](/page-shield/reference/roles-and-permissions/).

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Review detected scripts

When you enable client-side resource monitoring, it may take a while to get the list of detected scripts in your domain.

Review the scripts displayed in the [resource monitoring dashboard](/page-shield/detection/monitor-connections-scripts/), checking them for signs of malicious activity.

Depending on your plan, you may be able to also review the connections made by scripts in your domain's pages and check them for malicious activity.

## Configure alerts

<Render
	file="alerts-intro"
	params={{
		availabilityDetails:
			"The available alert types depend on your Cloudflare plan.",
	}}
/>

<Render file="alerts-configure" />

## Define policies

:::note
Only available to Enterprise customers with a paid add-on.
:::

[Policies](/page-shield/policies/), called content security rules in the [new security dashboard](/security/), define allowed resources on your websites. Create policies to implement a positive security model [^1].

1. [Create a policy](/page-shield/policies/create-dashboard/) with the _Log_ action.

2. After some time, [review the list of policy violations](/page-shield/policies/violations/) to make sure the policy is correct. Update the policy if needed.

3. Change the policy action to _Allow_ to start blocking resources not covered by the policy.

[^1]: A positive security model is one that defines what is allowed and rejects everything else. In contrast, a negative security model defines what will be rejected and accepts the rest.
