title: Total threats stopped

Total Threats Stopped measures the number of 'suspicious' and 'bad' requests that were aimed at your site. Requests receive these labels as they enter Cloudflare's network:

- **Legitimate:** Request passed directly to your site.
- **Suspicious:** Request has been challenged with a [Cloudflare challenge](/cloudflare-challenges/).
- **Bad:** Request has been blocked because our Browser Integrity Check, or because of user configured settings like WAF rules or IP Access rules.

In addition to threat analytics you can also monitor search engine crawlers going to your websites. For most websites, threats and crawlers make up 20% to 50% of traffic.
