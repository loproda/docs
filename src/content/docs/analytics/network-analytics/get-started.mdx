## View the Network Analytics dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select an account that has access to Magic Transit or Spectrum.

2. Go to Account Home > **Analytics & Logs** > **Network Analytics**.

3. Configure the displayed data. You can [adjust the time range](/analytics/network-analytics/configure/time-range/), [select the main metric](/analytics/network-analytics/configure/displayed-data/#select-high-level-metric) (total packets or total bytes), [apply filters](/analytics/network-analytics/configure/displayed-data/#apply-filters), and more.

## Get Network Analytics data via API

Use the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/) to query data using the available [Network Analytics nodes](/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/network-analytics-v2/node-reference/).

## Send Network Analytics logs to a third-party service

[Create a Logpush job](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/) that sends Network analytics logs to your storage service, <GlossaryTooltip term="SIEM">SIEM solution</GlossaryTooltip>, or log management provider.

## Limitations

Users with the `Analytics` role will have visibility to IDs but will not see the following on the Network Analytics dashboard:

- Tunnel names
- Prefix names
- [Magic Firewall](/magic-firewall/) rules
- [DDoS managed rulesets](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/)
- Override names
