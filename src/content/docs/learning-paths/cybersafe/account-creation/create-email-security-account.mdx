To create your Email Security account, you will need the alphanumeric string on the URL when logged in to the Cloudflare dashboard.

Once you have created your [Cloudflare account](/learning-paths/cybersafe/account-creation/create-cloudflare-account/), your account team will create an Email Security account for you.

To establish your tenant, you will need the following information:

- Average monthly inbound message volume
