<GlossaryDefinition term="mTLS (mutual TLS)" />

[TLS (Transport Layer Security)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/) is a widely-used protocol to ensure secure communication over a network. It ensures confidentiality and integrity by encrypting data and validating the server using digital certificates.

Mutual TLS (mTLS) adds an extra layer by authenticating both parties involved in the communication. The client presents a certificate to the server (in this case Cloudflare) and vice versa.
