Magic Transit leverages Cloudflare's global anycast network. As of writing this guide, Cloudflare's global network spans <PublicStats id="data_center_cities" />, and has <PublicStats id="total_bandwidth" />. This bandwidth allows it to absorb all manners of attack that otherwise would overwhelm a typical data center or on-premise hardware Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) appliances.

The number of DDoS attacks has been steadily increasing in recent years. In the first quarter of 2025, Cloudflare [mitigated 16.8 million network-layer DDoS attacks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2025-q1/#ddos-attacks-in-numbers). This represents a 397% increase quarter over quarter and a 509% increase year over year.
