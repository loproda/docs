Cloudflare Tunnel is an outbound-only daemon service that can run on nearly any host machine and proxies local traffic once validated from the Cloudflare network. User traffic initiated from the WARP endpoint client onramps to Cloudflare, passes down your Cloudflare Tunnel connections, and terminates automatically in your local network. Traffic reaching your internal applications or services will carry the local source IP address of the host machine running the `cloudflared` daemon.

## Create a tunnel

To connect your private network:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI">

<TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render file="tunnel/create-tunnel" product="cloudflare-one" />

9. In the **Private Networks** tab, enter the CIDR of your private network (for example, `10.0.0.0/8`).

10. Select **Save tunnel**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform (v5)">

1. Add the following permission to your [`cloudflare_api_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/api_token):
	- `Cloudflare Tunnel Write`

2. Create a tunnel using the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflare`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared) resource.

		```tf
		resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared" "example_tunnel" {
			account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
			name       = "Example tunnel"
			config_src = "cloudflare"
		}
		```

3. Route the CIDR of your private network through the tunnel using the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_route`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_route) resource:

		```tf
		resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_route" "example_tunnel_route" {
			account_id         = var.cloudflare_account_id
			tunnel_id          = cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared.example_tunnel.id
			network            = "10.0.0.0/8"
			comment            = "Example tunnel route"
		}
		```

4. Get the [token](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/remote-tunnel-permissions/) used to run the tunnel:
		<Render file="terraform/get-tunnel-token" product="cloudflare-one" />

5. Install `cloudflared` on a host machine in your private network and run the tunnel:

		<Render file="tunnel/install-and-run-tunnel" product="cloudflare-one" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

All internal applications and services in this IP range are now connected to Cloudflare.

:::note

If the tunnel is disconnected:

* Ensure that your on-premise or cloud firewall allows egress traffic on the [required ports](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/tunnel-with-firewall/#required-for-tunnel-operation).
* Ensure that the `cloudflared` host machine can connect to your internal applications and services. Verify that the host has the proper security group memberships and that no firewalls will block traffic between the host and the target services.


:::

## Best practices

* Segregate production and staging traffic among different Cloudflare tunnels.
* Add a [`cloudflared` replica](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/tunnel-availability/) to another host machine for an additional point of availability.
* Distribute access to critical services (for example, private DNS, Active Directory, and other critical systems) across different tunnels for blast-radius reduction in the event of a server-side outage.
* [Enable notifications](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/notifications/) in the Cloudflare dashboard to monitor tunnel health.
* [Monitor performance metrics](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/metrics/) to identify potential bottlenecks.
* [Update `cloudflared`](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/update-cloudflared/) regularly.
