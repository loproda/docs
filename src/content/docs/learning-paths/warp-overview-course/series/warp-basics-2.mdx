  In this more advanced episode, we explain how to use warp-diag files to identify and resolve connection issues with the WARP client. You will learn how to locate and interpret three key files: `warp-status`, `warp-settings`, and `daemon.log`. The video also provides troubleshooting tips including specific keyword searches and guidance on how to cross-reference logs to identify a bigger picture of the problem.
