title: Using Cloudflare and Drupal Five Easy Recommended Steps
---

## Overview

These basic steps will help reduce common areas of confusion for Drupal users that are new to using Cloudflare to speed up and protect their sites. In addition, these steps are very quick and will generally take only a few minutes of your time to go through.

**Step #1**

Install the [Cloudflare Drupal plugin](https://drupal.org/project/cloudflare) to restore visitor IP information. Since Cloudflare acts as a proxy for sites using our network, Cloudflare’s IPs are going to show in your logs, including comments, unless you install something to restore the original visitor IP.

Why should you install the plugin?

If you receive a lot of comments or spam on your blog, you may mistakenly believe that Cloudflare is spamming you. Some other Drupal plugins or extensions may also rely on the original visitor IP for the services to work properly and reduce false alerts.

Note: You don’t need to worry about this if you activated through a certified Cloudflare [certified Cloudflare Hosting partner](https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/technology-partners/), since they already [restore visitor IPs](/support/troubleshooting/restoring-visitor-ips/restoring-original-visitor-ips/) by default.

**Step #2**

Create a [Page Rule](/rules/page-rules/) to exclude the Drupal admin or Drupal login sections from Cloudflare’s caching and performance features. You can access Page Rules in **Rules** > **Page Rules**.

Why do this?

While there is not always an issue, we have seen some optional performance features like Rocket Loader inadvertently breaking certain functions (editors, etc.) in your site's admin area.

**Step #3**

[Skip some security features](/waf/custom-rules/skip/) for specific IP addresses you expect traffic from. Some common services you probably want to allow include:

- APIs you are getting data from
- Monitoring services you use to monitor your site's uptime
- Security services
- IP addresses you frequently log in from

Why do this?

If you have enabled and configured [Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall](/waf/), legitimate services and/or you may get challenged while accessing your backend. To prevent issues on your site, consider skipping certain security features for requests coming from known IP addresses.

**Note:** Cloudflare allows known search engine and social media crawlers. If you decide to block specific countries, you must use care because you may end up inadvertently blocking their crawlers (blocking the USA, for example, could mean that their crawler gets challenged).

**Step #4**

If you are using services like `.htaccess`, firewalls, or server mods to manage access to your site from visitors, it is vitally important to make sure requests from [Cloudflare's IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips) are not being blocked or limited in any way. The number one cause of site offline issues in our support channel is something blocking or restricting requests from our IPs, so please take the time to make sure that all of Cloudflare's IPs are allowed on your server and with your hosting provider.

Why do this?

Prevent false offline messages from appearing on your site to you or visitors.

**Note:** You do not need to ask your host to allow our IPs when activating through a hosting partner. You should still make sure any other security services you're running on the site have our IPs allowed.
