Cloudflare provides updates on the status of our services and network at https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/, which you should check if you notice unexpected behavior with Cloudflare.

Beyond looking at the page itself, there are programmatic ways to consume this information.

## Configure notifications

Cloudflare offers a dedicated notification called **Incident Alert**, which lets you know when Cloudflare is experiencing an incident.

You can configure this notification to send via [email](/notifications/get-started/), [Webhooks](/notifications/get-started/configure-webhooks/), or [PagerDuty](/notifications/get-started/configure-pagerduty/).

## Use the API

Cloudflare also provides status information through the [Cloudflare Status API](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/api).

Endpoints are displayed with examples using cURL and our embeded JavaScript widget (if available).
