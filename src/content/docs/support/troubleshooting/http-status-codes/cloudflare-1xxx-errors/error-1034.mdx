## Error 1034: Edge IP Restricted

This error indicates that the IP address used for the domain is restricted by Cloudflare's edge validation.

### Common cause

Customers who previously pointed their domains to `1.1.1.1` will now encounter `1034` error. This is due to a new edge validation check in Cloudflare's systems to prevent misconfiguration and/or potential abuse.

### Resolution

Ensure DNS records are pointed to IP addresses you control, and in the case a placeholder IP address is needed for “originless” setups, use the IPv6 reserved address `100::` or the IPv4 reserved address `192.0.2.0`.
