## Error 1004: Host Not Configured to Serve Web Traffic

This error indicates that the host is not configured to serve web traffic.

### Common causes

- Cloudflare staff disabled proxying for the domain due to abuse or terms of service violations.
- DNS changes have not yet propagated or the site owner's DNS A records point to [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips).

### Resolution
