## Error 1033: Argo Tunnel error

This error indicates an issue with resolving an Argo Tunnel.

### Common cause

You have requested a page on a website (`tunnel.example.com`) that is on the Cloudflare network. The host (`tunnel.example.com`) is configured as an Argo Tunnel, and Cloudflare is currently unable to resolve it.

### Resolution

- **If you are a visitor to this website**: Please try again in a few minutes.
- **If you are the owner of this website**: Ensure that _cloudflared_ is running and can reach the network. You may wish to enable [load balancing](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/routing-to-tunnel/lb) for your tunnel.
