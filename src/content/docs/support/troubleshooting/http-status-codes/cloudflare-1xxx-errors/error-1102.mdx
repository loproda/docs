## Error 1102: Rendering error

This error indicates that a Cloudflare Worker has exceeded the CPU time limit.

### Common cause

A Cloudflare Worker exceeds a [CPU time limit](/workers/observability/errors/). CPU time is the time spent executing code (for example, loops, parsing JSON, etc). Time spent on network requests (fetching, responding) does not count towards CPU time.

### Resolution

Contact the developer of your Workers code to optimize code for a reduction in CPU usage in the active Workers scripts.
