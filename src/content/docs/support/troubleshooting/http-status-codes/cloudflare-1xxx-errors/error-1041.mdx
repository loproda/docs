## Error 1041: Invalid request rewrite (invalid header value)

This error indicates that the header value is not valid.

### Common causes

The added/modified header value is too long or it contains characters that are not allowed.

### Resolution

- Use a shorter value or expression to define the header value.
- Remove the characters that are not allowed. Refet to [Format of HTTP request header names and values](/rules/transform/request-header-modification/reference/header-format/) in Developer Docs for more information on the allowed characters.
