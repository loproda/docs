## Errors 1005 Access Denied: Autonomous System Number (ASN) banned

This error indicates that access to the website is denied due to the banning of the Autonomous System Number (ASN).

### Common causes

The owner of the website (for example, `example.com`) has banned the autonomous system number (ASN) from accessing the website.

### Resolution

If you are not the website owner, provide the website owner with a screenshot of the 1005 error message you received.

If you are the website owner:

1. Retrieve a screenshot of the `1005` error from your customer
2. Search the [**Security Events log**](/waf/analytics/security-events/) (available at **Security** > **Events**) for the **RayID**, or client IP Address from the visitor's 1005 error message.

:::note
Convert the UTC timestamp of the `1005` error to your local timezone when searching in the **Security Events log**.
:::

3. Assess the cause of the block and ensure the ASN is allowed under the [IP Access Rules](/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/) security feature.
