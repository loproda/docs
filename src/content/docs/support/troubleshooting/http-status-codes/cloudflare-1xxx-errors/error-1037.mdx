## Error 1037: Invalid rewrite rule (failed to evaluate expression)

This error indicates that the rewrite rule expression could not be evaluated.

### Common cause

There are several causes for this error, but it can mean that one expression element contained an undefined value when it was evaluated.

For example, you get a 1037 error when using the following URL rewrite dynamic expression and the `X-Source` header is not included in the request:

`http.request.headers["x-source"][0]`

### Resolution

Make sure that all the elements of your rewrite expression are defined. For example, if you are referring to a header value, ensure the header is set.
