## Error 1013: HTTP hostname and TLS SNI hostname mismatch

This error indicates a mismatch between the HTTP hostname and the TLS SNI hostname.

### Common cause

The hostname sent by the client or browser via <GlossaryTooltip term="Server Name Indication (SNI)">Server Name Indication (SNI)</GlossaryTooltip> does not match the request host header.

### Resolution

Error `1013` is commonly caused by the following:

- Your local browser setting the incorrect SNI host header, or
- A network proxying SSL traffic caused a mismatch between SNI and the Host header of the request.

Test for an SNI mismatch via an online tool, such as [SSL Shopper](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html).
