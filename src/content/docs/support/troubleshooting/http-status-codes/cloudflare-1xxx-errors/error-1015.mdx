## Error 1015: You are being rate limited

This error indicates that you are being rate limited by the website.

### Common cause

The site owner implemented [Rate Limiting](/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/) that affects your visitor traffic.

:::note
_Unable to purge_ is another `1015` error code relating to [Cloudflare cache purge](/cache/how-to/purge-cache). Retry the cache purge and contact [Cloudflare support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) if errors persist.
:::

### Resolution

- If you are a site visitor, contact the site owner to request exclusion of your IP from rate limiting.
- If you are the site owner, review [Cloudflare Rate Limiting thresholds](/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/) and adjust your Rate Limiting configuration.
- If your Rate Limiting blocks requests in a short time period (for example, one second) try increasing the time period to 10 seconds.

:::note
If you expect a new Cloudflare Worker to exceed rate limits, refer to the [Workers documentation](/workers/platform/limits/) for guidance.
