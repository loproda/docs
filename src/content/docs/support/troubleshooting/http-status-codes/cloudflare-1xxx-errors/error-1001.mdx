## Error 1001: DNS resolution error

This error indicates a DNS resolution failure preventing access to the requested domain.

### Common causes

- A web request was sent to a Cloudflare IP address for a non-existent Cloudflare domain.
- An external domain that is not on using Cloudflare has a CNAME record to a domain active on Cloudflare
- The target of the DNS CNAME record does not resolve.
- A CNAME record in your Cloudflare DNS app requires resolution via a DNS provider that is currently offline.
- [Always Online](/cache/how-to/always-online/) is enabled for a [Custom Hostname (Cloudflare for SaaS)](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/) domain.

### Resolution

A non-Cloudflare domain cannot CNAME to a Cloudflare domain, unless the non-Cloudflare domain is added to a Cloudflare account.

Attempting to directly access DNS records used for [Cloudflare CNAME setups](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup) also causes error 1001. For example, `www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net`.

Disable [Always Online](/cache/how-to/always-online/#enable-always-online), if using [Custom Hostname (Cloudflare for SaaS)](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/) domain.
