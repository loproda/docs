## Error 1011: Access Denied (Hotlinking Denied)

This error indicates that access to the resource is denied due to hotlinking protection.

### Common cause

A request is made for a resource that uses [Cloudflare hotlink protection](/waf/tools/scrape-shield/hotlink-protection/).

### Resolution

Notify the website owner of the blocking. If you cannot determine how to contact the website owner, lookup contact information for the domain via the [Whois database](https://lookup.icann.org/). **Hotlink Protection** is managed via the Cloudflare **Scrape Shield** app.

:::note
Since the website owner performed the blocking, Cloudflare support cannot override a customer's security settings.
