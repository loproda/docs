## Error 10055: Query string settings incompatible with redirect target URL

This error indicates a conflict between the **Preserve query string** option and the query string in the redirect target URL.

### Common causes

This error occurs when you enable the **Preserve query string** option of a URL redirect, but also provide a query string in the redirect target URL. In this case, the URL redirect would have conflicting configuration on how to handle the query string of incoming requests.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, either disable the **Preserve query string** option in the URL redirect or remove the query string component from the redirect target URL to eliminate the conflict.
