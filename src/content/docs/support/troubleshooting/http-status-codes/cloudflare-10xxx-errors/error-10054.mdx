## Error 10054: Invalid redirect source URL with fragment

This error indicates that the source URL includes an unsupported fragment component.

### Common causes

This error occurs when the source URL of a URL redirect includes a fragment component (for example, `https://example.com/search/#fragment`). Fragment components are not part of an HTTP request; they are an indication for the browser to scroll to a specific location once the page has loaded. Possible causes of this error include copying a URL with a fragment from a browser or external source, or inadvertently adding a fragment during URL configuration or editing.

### Resolution

Remove the fragment from the redirect source URL. Refer to [Supported URL components in Bulk Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/url-components/) for details on the supported URL components for redirect source URLs.
