## Error 10060: Missing scheme in redirect target URL

This error indicates that the target URL is missing a scheme.

### Common causes

This error occurs when the target URL of a URL redirect does not include a scheme, which is mandatory. This could have happened due to a typo or the URL was copied from a source that did not include the scheme.

### Resolution

Review the target URL of the URL redirect and ensure that it contains a scheme (for example, `https`). Refer to [Supported URL components in Bulk Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/url-components/) for details on the required URL components for redirect target URLs.
