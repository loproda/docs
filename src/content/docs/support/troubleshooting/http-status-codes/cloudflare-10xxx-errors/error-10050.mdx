## Error 10050: Invalid redirect source URL with user info

This error indicates that the source URL includes unsupported user information.

### Common causes

This error occurs when the source URL of a URL redirect includes a user info component (for example, `https://user:password@example.com`), which is not supported.

### Resolution

You need to remove the user information component from the redirect source URL. Refer to [Supported URL components in Bulk Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/url-components/) for details on the supported URL components for redirect source URLs.
