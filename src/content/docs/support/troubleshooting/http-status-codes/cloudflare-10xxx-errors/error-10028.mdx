## Error 10028: The add list items operation contains duplicate items

This error indicates that the operation to add items to a list contains duplicate entries within the same request.

### Common causes

This error occurs when there are duplicate list items in a single operation to add items to a List (either an IP list or a Bulk Redirect List). This error can happen when you:

- Add a repeated IP address to an IP list
- Add a repeated source URL to a Bulk Redirect List

### Resolution

You need to remove the duplicate item and try again.
