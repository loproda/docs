## Error 10051: Missing authority in redirect source URL

This error indicates that the source URL is missing a required authority component.

### Common causes

This error occurs when the source URL of a URL redirect does not include an authority component (for example, `http:///path`, without a hostname), which is mandatory.

### Resolution

Add an authority component to the redirect source URL (for example, include a hostname). Refer to [Supported URL components in Bulk Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/url-components/) for details on the required URL components for redirect source URLs.
