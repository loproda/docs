## Error 10045: Invalid redirect source URL

This error indicates that the source URL for a redirect is not valid.

### Common causes

This error occurs when the source URL provided for a URL redirect is not valid, preventing the redirect from functioning properly due to missing components, such as the scheme (for instance, `http` or `https`) or improper formatting.

### Resolution

You need to specify a valid URL as the source URL. Refer to [Supported URL components in Bulk Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/url-components/) for details on the supported URL components for redirect source URLs.
