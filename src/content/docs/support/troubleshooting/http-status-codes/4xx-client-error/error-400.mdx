## 400 Bad Request

This error indicates that the client sent a request to the server that could not be understood or processed due to issues with the request itself.

For more information, refer to [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

### Common use cases

A `400 Bad Request` error occurs due to client-side issues, such as malformed request syntax, invalid request content, message framing problems, or deceptive request routing. For example, if the request contains a special character that is not properly [URL Encoded (or percent-encoded)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding), an `HTTP Error 400` will be returned.

### Cloudflare-specific information

If you encounter an HTTP error while using the [Cloudflare API](/api/), make sure that you are using the correct syntax, parameters, and body for your API call.
