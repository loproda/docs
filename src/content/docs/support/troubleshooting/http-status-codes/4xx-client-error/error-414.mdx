## 414 URI Too Long

The `414 URI Too Long` status code indicates that the server refuses to process the request because the URI provided by the client is excessively long.

For more details, refer to [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

### Common use cases

For example, if a client is attempting a `GET` request with an unusually long URI, such as one containing an excessive number of query parameters, after a `POST`, this could be seen as a security risk and a `414` is generated.

### Cloudflare-specific information

Cloudflare will generate a `414` response if the URI length exceeds 32KB.
