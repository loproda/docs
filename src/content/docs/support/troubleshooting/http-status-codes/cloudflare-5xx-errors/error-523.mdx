## Error 523: origin is unreachable

This error occurs when Cloudflare cannot contact your origin web server.

### Common causes

This typically occurs when a network device between Cloudflare and the origin web server does not have a route to the origin's IP address.

### Resolution

Contact your hosting provider and share the necessary [error details](/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) to exclude the following common causes at your origin web server:

- Confirm the correct origin IP address is listed for A or AAAA records within your Cloudflare DNS app.
- Troubleshoot Internet routing issues between your origin and Cloudflare, or with the origin itself.

If none of the above leads to a resolution, request the following information from your hosting provider or site administrator:

- An [MTR or traceroute](/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#perform-a-traceroute) from your origin web server to a [Cloudflare IP address](http://www.cloudflare.com/ips) that most commonly connected to your origin web server before the issue occurred. Identify a connecting Cloudflare IP from the logs of the origin web server.
