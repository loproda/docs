## Error 521: web server is down

Error `521` occurs when the origin web server refuses connections from Cloudflare. Security solutions at your origin may block legitimate connections from certain [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips).

### Common causes

The two most common causes of `521` errors are:

- Offlined origin web server application.
- Blocked Cloudflare requests.

### Resolution

Contact your hosting provider or site administrator and share the necessary [error details](/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) to assist in troubleshooting these common causes:

- Ensure your origin web server is responsive.
- Review origin web server error logs to identify web server application crashes or outages.
- Confirm [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips) are not blocked or rate limited.
- Allow all [Cloudflare IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips) in your origin web server's firewall or other security software.
- Confirm that — if you have your **SSL/TLS mode** set to **Full** or **Full (Strict**) — your origin supports HTTPS and/or you have installed a [Cloudflare Origin Certificate](/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca) or a certificate matching the [requirements for these modes](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/#custom-ssltls).
