## Error 526: invalid SSL certificate

This error indicates that Cloudflare is unable to verify the SSL certificate on your origin server, preventing a secure connection from being established.

### Common causes

This error occurs when these two conditions are true:

- Cloudflare cannot validate the SSL certificate at your origin web server.
- [_Full SSL (Strict)_](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) **SSL** is set in the **Overview** tab of your Cloudflare **SSL/TLS** app.

#### Resolution

Here are some options to fix or workaround this issue:

- For a potential quick fix, set **SSL** to _Full_ instead of _Full (strict)_ in the **Overview** tab of your Cloudflare **SSL/TLS** app for the domain.

- Add your self-signed SSL certificate to the [Custom Origin Trust Store](/ssl/origin-configuration/custom-origin-trust-store/). This allows the Cloudflare edge to recognize your self-signed SSL certificate as valid.

- Use a [Cloudflare Origin CA certificate](/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/) at your origin.

- Request your server administrator or hosting provider to review the origin web server's SSL certificates and verify that:
  - Certificate is not expired.
  - Certificate is not revoked.
  - Certificate is signed by a [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) (not self-signed).
  - The requested or target domain name and hostname are in the certificate's **Common Name** or **Subject Alternative Name**.
  - Your origin web server accepts connections over port SSL port `443`.
  - [Temporarily pause Cloudflare](/fundamentals/manage-domains/pause-cloudflare/) and visit [https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=www.example.com](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=www.example.com) (replace `www.example.com` with your hostname and domain) to verify no issues exists with the origin SSL certificate:

### Error 526 in the Zero Trust context

When using [Cloudflare Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/), an HTTP Error `526` might be returned in the [following cases](/cloudflare-one/faq/troubleshooting/#i-see-error-526-when-browsing-to-a-website):

- **An untrusted certificate is presented from the origin to Gateway.** Gateway will consider a certificate is untrusted if any of these conditions are true:

  - The server certificate issuer is unknown or is not trusted by the service.
  - The server certificate is revoked and fails a CRL check.
  - There is at least one expired certificate in the certificate chain for the server certificate.
  - The common name on the certificate does not match the URL you are trying to reach.
  - The common name on the certificate contains invalid characters (such as underscores). Gateway uses [BoringSSL](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search?SearchMode=Basic&Vendor=Google&CertificateStatus=Active&ValidationYear=0) to validate certificates. Chrome's [validation logic](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/net/cert/x509_certificate.cc#429) allows non-RFC 1305 compliant certificates, which is why the website may load when you turn off WARP.

- **The connection from Gateway to the origin is insecure.** Gateway does not trust origins which:

  - Only offer insecure cipher suites (such as RC4, RC4-MD5, or 3DES). You can use the [SSL Server Test tool](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html) to check which ciphers are supported by the origin.
  - Do not support [FIPS-compliant ciphers](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/#cipher-suites) (if you have enabled [FIPS compliance mode](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/#fips-compliance)). In order to load the page, you can either disable FIPS mode or create a Do Not Inspect policy for this host (which has the effect of disabling FIPS compliance for this origin).
  - Redirect all HTTPS requests to HTTP.


### Error 526 in the Workers context

Workers subrequests to any hostname outside your Cloudflare zone that is not proxied by Cloudflare are always made using the **[Full (strict)](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/)** SSL mode, regardless of the Workers zone configuration.

#### Resolution

- Make sure the SSL certificate configured at the origin is valid.

- Add your self-signed SSL certificate to the [Custom Origin Trust Store](/ssl/origin-configuration/custom-origin-trust-store/) and enable the [`cots_on_external_fetch` compatibility flag](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#do-not-use-the-custom-origin-trust-store-for-external-subrequests) in your Worker's configuration. 
This flag enables the use of the [Custom Origin Trust Store](/ssl/origin-configuration/custom-origin-trust-store/) when making external (grey-clouded) subrequests from a Cloudflare Worker.
