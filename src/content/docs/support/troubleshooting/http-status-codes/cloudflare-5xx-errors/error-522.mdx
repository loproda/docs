## Error 522: connection timed out

Error `522` occurs when Cloudflare times out contacting the origin web server.

### Common causes

Two different timeouts cause HTTP error `522` depending on when they occur between Cloudflare and the origin web server:

- Before a connection is established, the origin web server does not return a SYN+ACK to Cloudflare within 19 seconds of Cloudflare sending a SYN.
- After a connection is established, the origin web server does not acknowledge (ACK) Cloudflare's resource request within 90 seconds.

### Resolution

- Contact your hosting provider and share the necessary [error details](/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) to assist in troubleshooting these common causes:

  - [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) are rate limited or blocked in .htaccess, iptables, or firewalls. Confirm your hosting provider allows Cloudflare IP addresses (most common cause).
  - An overloaded or offline origin web server drops incoming requests.
  - [Keepalives](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/overview.html) are disabled at the origin web server.
  - The origin IP address in your Cloudflare **DNS** app does not match the IP address currently provisioned to your origin web server by your hosting provider.
  - Packets were dropped at your origin web server.

- If you are using [Cloudflare Pages](/pages/), verify that you have a custom domain set up and that your CNAME record is pointed to your [custom Pages domain](/pages/configuration/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-domain).

- If you are using [Workers with a Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), performing a `fetch` to its own hostname will cause a `522` error. Consider using a [Route](/workers/configuration/routing/), targeting another hostname, or enabling the [`global_fetch_strictly_public` compatibility flag](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#global-fetch-strictly-public) instead.

- If none of the above leads to a resolution, request the following information from your hosting provider or site administrator before [contacting Cloudflare support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/):

  - An [MTR or traceroute](/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#perform-a-traceroute) from your origin web server to a [Cloudflare IP address](http://www.cloudflare.com/ips) that most commonly connected to your origin web server before the issue occurred. Identify a connecting Cloudflare IP recorded in the origin web server logs.
  - Details from the hosting provider's investigation, such as pertinent logs or conversations with the hosting provider.
