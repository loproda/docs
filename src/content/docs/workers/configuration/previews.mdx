# Overview

Preview URLs allow you to preview new versions of your Worker without deploying it to production.

There are two types of preview URLs:

- **Versioned Preview URLs**: A unique URL generated automatically for each new version of your Worker.
- **Aliased Preview URLs**: A static, human-readable alias that you can manually assign to a Worker version.

Both preview URL types follow the format: `<VERSION_PREFIX OR ALIAS>-<WORKER_NAME>.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`.

Preview URLs can be:

- Integrated into CI/CD pipelines, allowing automatic generation of preview environments for every pull request.
- Used for collaboration between teams to test code changes in a live environment and verify updates.
- Used to test new API endpoints, validate data formats, and ensure backward compatibility with existing services.

When testing zone level performance or security features for a version, we recommend using [version overrides](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/#version-overrides) so that your zone's performance and security settings apply.

:::note
Preview URLs are only available for Worker versions uploaded after 2024-09-25.

## Types of Preview URLs

### Versioned Preview URLs

Every time you create a new [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of your Worker, a unique static version preview URL is generated automatically. These URLs use a version prefix and follow the format `<VERSION_PREFIX>-<WORKER_NAME>.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`.

New versions of a Worker are created when you run:

- [`wrangler deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy)
- [`wrangler versions upload`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#upload)
- Or when you make edits via the Cloudflare dashboard

These URLs are public by default and available immediately after version creation.

:::note
Minimum required Wrangler version: 3.74.0. Check your version by running `wrangler --version`. To update Wrangler, refer to [Install/Update Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
:::

#### View versioned preview URLs using Wrangler

The [`wrangler versions upload`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#upload) command uploads a new [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of your Worker and returns a preview URL for each version uploaded.

#### View versioned preview URLs on the Workers dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers) and select your project.
2. Go to the **Deployments** tab, and find the version you would like to view.

### Aliased preview URLs

Aliased preview URLs let you assign a persistent, readable alias to a specific Worker version. These are useful for linking to stable previews across many versions (e.g. to share an upcoming but still actively being developed new feature). A common workflow would be to assign an alias for the branch that you're working on. These types of preview URLs follow the same pattern as other preview URLs:
`<ALIAS>-<WORKER_NAME>.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`

:::note
Minimum required Wrangler version: `4.21.0`. Check your version by running `wrangler --version`. To update Wrangler, refer to [Install/Update Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
:::

#### Create an Alias

Aliases may be created during `versions upload`, by providing the `--preview-alias` flag with a valid alias name:

```bash
wrangler versions upload --preview-alias staging
```

The resulting alias would be associated with this version, and immediately available at:
`staging-<WORKER_NAME>.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`

#### Rules and limitations

- Aliases may only be created during version upload.
- Aliases must use only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes.
- Aliases must begin with a lowercase letter.
- The alias and Worker name combined (with a dash) must not exceed 63 characters due to DNS label limits.
- Only the 1000 most recently deployed aliases are retained. When a new alias is created beyond this limit, the least recently deployed alias is deleted.

## Manage access to Preview URLs

By default, all preview URLs are enabled and available publicly. You can use [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) to require visitors to authenticate before accessing preview URLs. You can limit access to yourself, your teammates, your organization, or anyone else you specify in your [access policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/access).

To limit your preview URLs to authorized emails only:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare Access dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/access/apps).
2. Select your account.
3. Add an application.
4. Select **Self Hosted**.
5. Name your application (for example, "my-worker") and add your `workers.dev` subdomain as the **Application domain**.

For example, if you want to secure preview URLs for a Worker running on `my-worker.my-subdomain.workers.dev`.

- Subdomain: `*-my-worker`
- Domain: `my-subdomain.workers.dev`

:::note
You must press enter after you input your Application domain for it to save. You will see a "Zone is not associated with the current account" warning that you may ignore.
:::

6. Go to the next page.
7. Add a name for your access policy (for example, "Allow employees access to preview URLs for my-worker").
8. In the **Configure rules** section create a new rule with the **Emails** selector, or any other attributes which you wish to gate access to previews with.
9. Enter the emails you want to authorize. View [access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/#selectors) to learn about configuring alternate rules.
10. Go to the next page.
11. Add application.

## Disabling Preview URLs

Disabling Preview URLs will disable routing to both versioned and aliased preview URLs.

### Disabling Preview URLs in the dashboard

To disable Preview URLs for a Worker:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to **Workers & Pages** and in **Overview**, select your Worker.
3. Go to **Settings** > **Domains & Routes**.
4. On "Preview URLs" click "Disable".
5. Confirm you want to disable.

### Disabling Preview URLs in the [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/)

:::note
Wrangler 3.91.0 or higher is required to use this feature.
:::

To disable Preview URLs for a Worker, include the following in your Worker's Wrangler file:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
preview_urls = false
```

</WranglerConfig>

When you redeploy your Worker with this change, Preview URLs will be disabled.

:::caution

If you disable Preview URLs in the Cloudflare dashboard but do not update your Worker's Wrangler file with `preview_urls = false`, then Preview URLs will be re-enabled the next time you deploy your Worker with Wrangler.
:::

## Limitations

- Preview URLs are not generated for Workers that implement a [Durable Object](/durable-objects/).
- Preview URLs are not currently generated for [Workers for Platforms](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/) [user Workers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#user-workers). This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
- You cannot currently configure Preview URLs to run on a subdomain other than [`workers.dev`](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/).
- You cannot view logs for Preview URLs today, this includes Workers Logs, Wrangler tail and Logpush.
