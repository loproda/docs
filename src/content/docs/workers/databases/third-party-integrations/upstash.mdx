[Upstash](https://upstash.com/) is a serverless database with Redis\* and Kafka API. Upstash also offers QStash, a task queue/scheduler designed for the serverless.

## Upstash for Redis

To set up an integration with Upstash:

1. You need an existing Upstash database to connect to. [Create an Upstash database](https://docs.upstash.com/redis#create-a-database) or [load data from an existing database to Upstash](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/howto/connectclient).

2. Insert some data to your Upstash database. You can add data to your Upstash database in two ways:

   - Use the CLI directly from your Upstash console.
   - Alternatively, install [redis-cli](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) locally and run the following commands.

   ```sh
   set GB "Ey up?"
   ```

   ```sh output
   OK
   ```

   ```sh
   set US "Yo, whatâ€™s up?"
   ```

   ```sh output
   OK
   ```

   ```sh
   set NL "Hoi, hoe gaat het?"
   ```

   ```sh output
   OK
   ```

3. Configure the Upstash Redis credentials in your Worker:

   You need to add your Upstash Redis database URL and token as secrets to your Worker. Get these from your [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) under your database details, then add them as secrets using Wrangler:

   ```sh
   # Add the Upstash Redis URL as a secret
   npx wrangler secret put UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL
   # When prompted, paste your Upstash Redis REST URL
   
   # Add the Upstash Redis token as a secret
   npx wrangler secret put UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN
   # When prompted, paste your Upstash Redis REST token
   ```

4. In your Worker, install the `@upstash/redis`, a HTTP client to connect to your database and start manipulating data:

   <PackageManagers pkg="@upstash/redis" />

5. The following example shows how to make a query to your Upstash database in a Worker. The credentials needed to connect to Upstash have been added as secrets to your Worker.

   ```js
   import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/cloudflare";

   export default {
   	async fetch(request, env) {
   		const redis = Redis.fromEnv(env);

   		const country = request.headers.get("cf-ipcountry");
   		if (country) {
   			const greeting = await redis.get(country);
   			if (greeting) {
   				return new Response(greeting);
   			}
   		}

   		return new Response("Hello What's up!");
   	},
   };
   ```

   :::note

   `Redis.fromEnv(env)` automatically picks up the default `url` and `token` names created in the integration.

   If you have renamed the secrets, you must declare them explicitly like in the [Upstash basic example](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/redis-ts/getstarted#basic-usage).

## Upstash Kafka

To set up an integration with Upstash Kafka:

1. Create a [Kafka cluster and topic](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka).

2. Configure the Upstash Kafka credentials in your Worker:

   You need to add your Upstash Kafka connection details as secrets to your Worker. Get these from your [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) under your Kafka cluster details, then add them as secrets using Wrangler:

   ```sh
   # Add the Upstash Kafka URL as a secret
   npx wrangler secret put UPSTASH_KAFKA_REST_URL
   # When prompted, paste your Upstash Kafka REST URL
   
   # Add the Upstash Kafka username as a secret
   npx wrangler secret put UPSTASH_KAFKA_REST_USERNAME
   # When prompted, paste your Upstash Kafka username
   
   # Add the Upstash Kafka password as a secret
   npx wrangler secret put UPSTASH_KAFKA_REST_PASSWORD
   # When prompted, paste your Upstash Kafka password
   ```

3. In your Worker, install `@upstash/kafka`, a HTTP/REST based Kafka client:

   <PackageManagers pkg="@upstash/kafka" />

4. Use the [upstash-kafka](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-kafka/blob/main/README.md) JavaScript SDK to send data to Kafka.

Refer to [Upstash documentation on Kafka setup with Workers](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka/real-time-analytics/realtime_analytics_serverless_kafka_setup#option-1-cloudflare-workers) for more information. Replace `url`, `username` and `password` with the variables set by the integration.

## Upstash QStash

To set up an integration with Upstash QStash:

1. Configure the [publicly available HTTP endpoint](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash#1-public-api) that you want to send your messages to.

2. Configure the Upstash QStash credentials in your Worker:

   You need to add your Upstash QStash token as a secret to your Worker. Get your token from your [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) under QStash settings, then add it as a secret using Wrangler:

   ```sh
   # Add the QStash token as a secret
   npx wrangler secret put QSTASH_TOKEN
   # When prompted, paste your QStash token
   ```

3. In your Worker, install the `@upstash/qstash`, a HTTP client to connect to your database QStash endpoint:

   <PackageManagers pkg="@upstash/qstash" />

4. Refer to the [Upstash documentation on how to receive webhooks from QStash in your Cloudflare Worker](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash/quickstarts/cloudflare-workers#3-use-qstash-in-your-handler).
