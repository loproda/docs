An [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/events.html#class-eventemitter)
is an object that emits named events that cause listeners to be called.

```js
import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';

const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.on('hello', (...args) => {
  console.log(...args); // 1 2 3
});

emitter.emit('hello', 1, 2, 3);
```

The implementation in the Workers runtime supports the entire Node.js `EventEmitter` API. This includes the [`captureRejections`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/events.html#capture-rejections-of-promises)
option that allows improved handling of async functions as event handlers:

```js
const emitter = new EventEmitter({ captureRejections: true });
emitter.on('hello', async (...args) => {
  throw new Error('boom');
});
emitter.on('error', (err) => {
  // the async promise rejection is emitted here!
});
```

Like Node.js, when an `'error'` event is emitted on an `EventEmitter` and there
is no listener for it, the error will be immediately thrown. However, in Node.js
it is possible to add a handler on the `process` object for the
`'uncaughtException'` event to catch globally uncaught exceptions. The
`'uncaughtException'` event, however, is currently not implemented in the
Workers runtime. It is strongly recommended to always add an `'error'` listener
to any `EventEmitter` instance.

Refer to the [Node.js documentation for `EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter) for more information.
