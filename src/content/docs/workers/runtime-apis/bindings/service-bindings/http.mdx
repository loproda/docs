description: Facilitate Worker-to-Worker communication by forwarding Request objects.

---

import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

Worker A that declares a Service binding to Worker B can forward a [`Request`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/) object to Worker B, by calling the `fetch()` method that is exposed on the binding object.

For example, consider the following Worker that implements a [`fetch()` handler](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/):

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "worker_b"
main = "./src/workerB.js"
```

</WranglerConfig>

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return new Response("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

The following Worker declares a binding to the Worker above:



<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "worker_a"
main = "./src/workerA.js"
services = [
  { binding = "WORKER_B", service = "worker_b" }
]
```

</WranglerConfig>

And then can forward a request to it:

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		return await env.WORKER_B.fetch(request);
	},
};
```

:::note

If you construct a new request manually, rather than forwarding an existing one, ensure that you provide a valid and fully-qualified URL with a hostname. For example:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    // provide a valid URL
    let newRequest = new Request("https://valid-url.com", { method: "GET" });
    let response = await env.WORKER_B.fetch(newRequest);
    return response;
  }
};
```
