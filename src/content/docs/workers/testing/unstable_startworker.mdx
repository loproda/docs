:::note
For most users, Cloudflare recommends using the Workers Vitest integration. If you have been using `unstable_dev()`, refer to the [Migrate from `unstable_dev()` guide](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/migration-guides/migrate-from-unstable-dev/).

:::caution
`unstable_startWorker()` is an experimental API subject to breaking changes.
:::

If you do not want to use Vitest, consider using [Wrangler's `unstable_startWorker()` API](/workers/wrangler/api/#unstable_startworker). This API exposes the internals of Wrangler's dev server, and allows you to customise how it runs. Compared to using [Miniflare directly for testing](/workers/testing/miniflare/writing-tests/), you can pass in a Wrangler configuration file, and it will automatically load the configuration for you.

This example uses `node:test`, but should apply to any testing framework:

    ```ts
    import assert from "node:assert";
    import test, { after, before, describe } from "node:test";
    import { unstable_startWorker } from "wrangler";

    describe("worker", () => {
    	let worker;

    	before(async () => {
    		worker = await unstable_startWorker({ config: "wrangler.json" });
    	});

    	test("hello world", async () => {
    		assert.strictEqual(
    			await (await worker.fetch("http://example.com")).text(),
    			"Hello world",
    		);
    	});

    	after(async () => {
    		await worker.dispose();
    	});
    });

    ```
