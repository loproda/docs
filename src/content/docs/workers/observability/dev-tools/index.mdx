## Using DevTools

When running your Worker locally using the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) (`wrangler dev`) or using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/), you automatically have access to [Cloudflare's implementation](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/chrome-devtools-patches) of [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview).

You can use Chrome DevTools to:

- View logs directly in the Chrome console
- [Debug code by setting breakpoints](/workers/observability/dev-tools/breakpoints/)
- [Profile CPU usage](/workers/observability/dev-tools/cpu-usage/)
- [Observe memory usage and debug memory leaks in your code that can cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors](/workers/observability/dev-tools/memory-usage/)

## Opening DevTools

### Wrangler

- Run your Worker locally, by running `wrangler dev`
- Press the `D` key from your terminal to open DevTools in a browser tab

### Vite

- Run your Worker locally by running `vite`
- In a new Chrome tab, open the debug URL that shows in your console (for example, `http://localhost:5173/__debug`)

### Dashboard editor & playground

Both the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and the [Worker's Playground](https://workers.cloudflare.com/playground) include DevTools in the UI.
