## What is TanStack Start?

TanStack Start is a full-stack React framework powered by TanStack Router. It provides a full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling, and more using Vite and modern web standards.

## Create a new TanStack Start

TanStack Start Beta has significantly improved Cloudflare compatibility compared to the Alpha version, making deployment and development much more straightforward.

<Steps>

1.  **Create a new TanStack Start project**

    ```sh
    npx gitpick TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/start-basic start-basic
    cd start-basic
    npm install
    ```
    
    <Details header="How is this project set up?">
    			This command will clone the TanStack Start basic project to your local machine, change directory to the project, and install the dependencies. TanStack [provides other examples](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start#examples) that you can use by replacing `start-basic` with the example you want to use.
    </Details>

2.  **Develop locally**

    After creating your project, run the following command in your project directory to start a local development server. By default this starts a local development server on `http://localhost:3000/`

    <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

</Steps>

## Preparing for Deployment to Cloudflare Workers

Whether you created a new TanStack Start project or are using an existing project, you'll need to make some changes to prepare for deployment to Cloudflare Workers.

<Steps>

1. **Configure Vite for Cloudflare compatibility**

   Update your `vite.config.ts` file to use the `cloudflare-module` target for a compatible build:

   ```ts title="vite.config.ts" {14}
   import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
   import { defineConfig } from "vite";
   import tsConfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";

   export default defineConfig({
     server: {
       port: 3000,
     },
     plugins: [
       tsConfigPaths({
         projects: ["./tsconfig.json"],
       }),
       tanstackStart({
         target: "cloudflare-module", // Key configuration for Cloudflare compatibility
       }),
     ],
   });
   ```

   This single configuration change is all that's needed to make your TanStack Start application compatible with Cloudflare Workers.

2. **Add a Wrangler file**

   Create a `wrangler.jsonc` or `wrangler.toml` file in the root of your project, `wrangler.jsonc` is the recommended approach. This file is used to configure the Cloudflare Workers deployment.

   <WranglerConfig>

   ```json
   {
   	"$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
   	"name": "my-start-app",
   	"main": ".output/server/index.mjs",
   	"compatibility_date": "$today",
   	"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
   	"assets": {
   		"directory": ".output/public"
   	},
   	"observability": {
   		"enabled": true
   	},
   	"kv_namespaces": [
   		{
   			"binding": "CACHE",
   			"id": "<Your KV ID>"
   		}
   	]
   }
   ```

   </WranglerConfig>

   Note that the `directory` key is set to `.output/public`, which is the folder that will be filled with the build output. Additionally, the `main` key is set to `.output/server/index.mjs`, indicating to Cloudflare Workers where to locate the entry point for your application. The `kv_namespaces` section shows an example of how to configure a KV namespace binding.

3. **Add deployment scripts to package.json**

   Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file to streamline deployment and type generation:

   ```json title="package.json
   {
     "scripts": {
       ...
       "deploy": "npm run build && wrangler deploy",
       "cf-typegen": "wrangler types --env-interface Env"
     }
   }
   ```

   The `deploy` script combines building and deploying in one command, while `cf-typegen` generates TypeScript types for your Cloudflare bindings.
   
4. **Build the application**

   You must build your application before deploying it to Cloudflare Workers.

   <PackageManagers type="run" args={"build"} />

5. **Deploy the application**

   You can now use the deploy script to build and deploy your application in one command:

   <PackageManagers type="run" args={"deploy"} />

   Alternatively, you can still deploy directly with Wrangler:

   ```sh
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

</Steps>

## Using Cloudflare Bindings

<Steps>

1. **Generate TypeScript types for your bindings**

   Before using Cloudflare bindings in your code, generate the TypeScript types to ensure proper type safety:

   <PackageManagers type="run" args={"cf-typegen"} />

   This command reads your `wrangler.jsonc` configuration and generates an `Env` interface with all your configured bindings.

2. **Create a helper function to get access to Cloudflare bindings**

   Create a helper function named `bindings.ts` in the `src/utils` folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist), and paste in the below code. The example assumes you have a KV namespace with a binding name of `CACHE` already created in your account and added to the wrangler file.
   

   ```ts title="src/utils/bindings.ts"

   let cachedEnv: Env | null = null;

   // This gets called once at startup when running locally
   const initDevEnv = async () => {
   	const { getPlatformProxy } = await import("wrangler");
   	const proxy = await getPlatformProxy();
   	cachedEnv = proxy.env as unknown as Env;
   };

   if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
   	await initDevEnv();
   }

   /**
    * Will only work when being accessed on the server. Obviously, CF bindings are not available in the browser.
    * @returns
    */
   export function getBindings(): Env {
   	if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
   		if (!cachedEnv) {
   			throw new Error(
   				"Dev bindings not initialized yet. Call initDevEnv() first."
   			);
   		}
   		return cachedEnv;
   	}

   	return process.env as unknown as Env;
   }
   ```

   <Details header="How is this code working?">
   	The helper function uses [getPlatformProxy](/workers/wrangler/api/#getplatformproxy) method from wrangler to provide access to your Cloudflare bindings during local development. The bindings are cached at startup for better performance. In production, bindings are accessed via `process.env`. Make sure you've run `npm run cf-typegen` to generate the `Env` types that this code references.
   </Details>

3. **Example using a Cloudflare Binding in Server Functions**

   Now that you have a helper function to get access to your Cloudflare bindings, you can use them in your server functions.

   Remember bindings are only available on the server.

   ```ts
   import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
   import { getBindings } from "~/utils/bindings";

   const personServerFn = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
   	.validator((d: string) => d)
   	.handler(async ({ data: name }) => {
   		const env = getBindings();
   		let growingAge = Number((await env.CACHE.get("age")) || 0);
   		growingAge++;
   		await env.CACHE.put("age", growingAge.toString());
   		return { name, randomNumber: growingAge };
   	});
   ```

   A special thanks to GitHub user [backpine](https://github.com/backpine) for the code that supports Cloudflare Bindings in TanStack Start, which is demonstrated in their [TanStack Start Beta on Cloudflare example](https://github.com/backpine/tanstack-start-beta-on-cloudflare).

</Steps>

## Environment Handling

The TanStack Start Beta version provides seamless environment handling:

- **Development**: Bindings are accessed via [`getPlatformProxy()`](/workers/wrangler/api/#getplatformproxy) from Wrangler and cached at startup
- **Production**: Bindings are accessed via [`process.env`](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/process/#processenv)

This approach ensures your bindings are properly typed throughout your project and provides a smooth development experience.

By following the steps above, you will have deployed your TanStack Start application to Cloudflare Workers.
