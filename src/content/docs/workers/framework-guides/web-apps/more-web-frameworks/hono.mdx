**Start from CLI** - scaffold a full-stack app with a Hono API, React SPA and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/) for lightning-fast development.

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args="my-hono-app --template=cloudflare/templates/vite-react-template"
/>
---

**Or just deploy** - create a full-stack app using Hono, React and Vite, with CI/CD and previews all set up for you.

## What is Hono?

[Hono](https://hono.dev/) is an ultra-fast, lightweight framework for building web applications, and works fantastically with Cloudflare Workers.
With Workers Assets, you can easily combine a Hono API running on Workers with a SPA to create a full-stack app.

## Creating a full-stack Hono app with a React SPA

<Steps>
1. **Create a new project with the create-cloudflare CLI (C3)**

    	<PackageManagers
    	type="create"
    	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
    	args="my-hono-app --template=cloudflare/templates/vite-react-template"
    	/>
    		 <Details header="How is this project set up?">
        			Below is a simplified file tree of the project.
        			<FileTree>
        			- my-hono-app
        				- src
        					- worker/
        						- index.ts
        					- react-app/
        				- index.html
        				- vite.config.ts
        				- wrangler.jsonc
        			</FileTree>

        			`wrangler.jsonc` is your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
        			In this file:
        					- `main` points to `src/worker/index.ts`. This is your Hono app, which will run in a Worker.
        					- `assets.not_found_handling` is set to `single-page-application`, which means that routes that are handled by your SPA do not go to the Worker, and are thus free.
        					- If you want to add bindings to resources on Cloudflare's developer platform, you configure them here. Read more about [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/).

    						`vite.config.ts` is set up to use the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/). This runs your Worker in the Cloudflare Workers runtime, ensuring your local development environment is as close to production as possible.

    						`src/worker/index.ts` is your Hono app, which contains a single endpoint to begin with, `/api`.
    						At `src/react-app/src/App.tsx`, your React app calls this endpoint to get a message back and displays this in your SPA.
        		</Details>

2.  **Develop locally with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/)**

        After creating your project, run the following command in your project directory to start a local development server.
        <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />
        		<Details header="What's happening in local development?">
        			This project uses Vite for local development and build, and thus comes with all of Vite's features, including hot module replacement (HMR).

        			In addition, `vite.config.ts` is set up to use the Cloudflare Vite plugin. This runs your application in the Cloudflare Workers runtime, just like in production, and enables access to local emulations of bindings.
        		</Details>

3.  **Deploy your project**

        	Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including Cloudflare's own [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

        	The following command will build and deploy your project. If you are using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

        	<PackageManagers type="run" args={"deploy"} />

</Steps>

## Bindings

The [Hono documentation](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/cloudflare-workers#bindings) provides information on how you can access bindings in your Hono app.
