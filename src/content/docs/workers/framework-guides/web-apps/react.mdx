**Start from CLI** - scaffold a full-stack app with a React SPA, Cloudflare Workers API, and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/) for lightning-fast development.

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args="my-react-app --framework=react"
/>

**Or just deploy** - create a full-stack app using React, Hono API and Vite, with CI/CD and previews all set up for you.

[![Deploy to Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/create/deploy-to-workers&repository=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/vite-react-template)

## What is React?

[React](https://react.dev/) is a framework for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently. You can use React to build a single-page application (SPA), and combine it with a backend API running on Cloudflare Workers to create a full-stack application.

## Creating a full-stack app with React

<Steps>
1. **Create a new project with the create-cloudflare CLI (C3)**

    	<PackageManagers
    		type="create"
    		pkg="cloudflare@latest"
    		args="my-react-app --framework=react"
    	/>
    		 <Details header="How is this project set up?">
        			Below is a simplified file tree of the project.
        			<FileTree>
    							- my-react-app
    								- src/
    										- App.tsx
    								- worker/
    									- index.ts
    								- index.html
    								- vite.config.ts
    								- wrangler.jsonc
        			</FileTree>

        			`wrangler.jsonc` is your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
        			In this file:
        					- `main` points to `worker/index.ts`. This is your Worker, which is going to act as your backend API.
        					- `assets.not_found_handling` is set to `single-page-application`, which means that routes that are handled by your React SPA do not go to the Worker, and are thus free.
        					- If you want to add bindings to resources on Cloudflare's developer platform, you configure them here. Read more about [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/).

    						`vite.config.ts` is set up to use the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/). This runs your Worker in the Cloudflare Workers runtime, ensuring your local development environment is as close to production as possible.

    						`worker/index.ts` is your backend API, which contains a single endpoint, `/api/`, that returns a text response.
    						At `src/App.tsx`, your React app calls this endpoint to get a message back and displays this.
        		</Details>

2.  **Develop locally with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/)**

        After creating your project, run the following command in your project directory to start a local development server.
        <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />
        		<Details header="What's happening in local development?">
        			This project uses Vite for local development and build, and thus comes with all of Vite's features, including hot module replacement (HMR).

        			In addition, `vite.config.ts` is set up to use the Cloudflare Vite plugin. This runs your application in the Cloudflare Workers runtime, just like in production, and enables access to local emulations of bindings.
        		</Details>

3.  **Deploy your project**

        	Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including Cloudflare's own [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

        	The following command will build and deploy your project. If you are using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

        	<PackageManagers type="run" args={"deploy"} />

</Steps>

## Asset Routing

If you're using React as a SPA, you will want to set `not_found_handling = "single_page_application"` in your Wrangler configuration file.

<Render file="workers-assets-routing-summary" />

## Use bindings with React

Your new project also contains a Worker at `./worker/index.ts`, which you can use as a backend API for your React application. While your React application cannot directly access Workers bindings, it can interact with them through this Worker. You can make [`fetch()` requests](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) from your React application to the Worker, which can then handle the request and use bindings. Learn how to [configure Workers bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/).
