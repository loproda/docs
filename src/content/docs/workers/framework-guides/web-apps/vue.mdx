In this guide, you will create a new [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) application and deploy to Cloudflare Workers (with the new [Workers Assets](/workers/static-assets/)).

## 1. Set up a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, use code from the official Vue template, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Vue project with Workers Assets, run the following command:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args="my-vue-app --framework=vue"
/>

    		 <Details header="How is this project set up?">
        			Below is a simplified file tree of the project.
        			<FileTree>
    						- my-vue-app
    							- src/
    									- App.vue
    							- server/
    								- index.ts
    							- index.html
    							- vite.config.ts
    							- wrangler.jsonc
        			</FileTree>

        			`wrangler.jsonc` is your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
        			In this file:
        					- `main` points to `server/index.ts`. This is your Worker, which is going to act as your backend API.
        					- `assets.not_found_handling` is set to `single-page-application`, which means that routes that are handled by your Vue SPA do not go to the Worker, and are thus free.
        					- If you want to add bindings to resources on Cloudflare's developer platform, you configure them here. Read more about [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/).

    						`vite.config.ts` is set up to use the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/). This runs your Worker in the Cloudflare Workers runtime, ensuring your local development environment is as close to production as possible.

    						`server/index.ts` is your backend API, which contains a single endpoint, `/api/`, that returns a text response.
    						At `src/App.vue`, your Vue app calls this endpoint to get a message back and displays this.
        		</Details>

## **Develop locally with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/)**

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"dev"} />
<Details header="What's happening in local development?">
	This project uses Vite for local development and build, and thus comes with
	all of Vite's features, including hot module replacement (HMR). In addition,
	`vite.config.ts` is set up to use the [Cloudflare Vite
	plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/). This runs your application in the Cloudflare
	Workers runtime, just like in production, and enables access to local
	emulations of bindings.
</Details>

## 3. Deploy your project

Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including [Cloudflare's own](/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

The following command will build and deploy your project. If you are using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"deploy"} />

## Asset Routing

If you're using Vue as a SPA, you will want to set `not_found_handling = "single_page_application"` in your Wrangler configuration file.

<Render file="workers-assets-routing-summary" />

## Use bindings with Vue

Your new project also contains a Worker at `./server/index.ts`, which you can use as a backend API for your Vue application. While your Vue application cannot directly access Workers bindings, it can interact with them through this Worker. You can make [`fetch()` requests](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) from your Vue application to the Worker, which can then handle the request and use bindings.

<Render file="frameworks-bindings" />
