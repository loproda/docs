Static Site Generation (SSG) applications are web applications which are predominantely built or "prerendered" ahead-of-time. They are often built with a framework such as [Gatsby](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/more-web-frameworks/gatsby/) or [Docusaurus](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/more-web-frameworks/docusaurus/). The build process of these frameworks will produce many HTML files and accompanying client-side resources (e.g. JavaScript bundles, CSS stylesheets, images, fonts, etc.). Data is either static, fetched and compiled into the HTML at build-time, or fetched by the client from an API with client-side requests.

Often, an SSG framework will allow you to create a custom 404 page.

## Configuration

In order to deploy a Static Site Generation application to Workers, you must configure the `assets.directory`, and optionally, the `assets.not_found_handling` and `assets.html_handling` options in your [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#assets):

<WranglerConfig>

```json
{
	"name": "my-worker",
	"compatibility_date": "$today",
	"assets": {
		"directory": "./dist/",
		"not_found_handling": "404-page",
		"html_handling": "auto-trailing-slash"
	}
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

`assets.html_handling` defaults to `auto-trailing-slash` and this will usually give you the desired behavior automatically: individual files (e.g. `foo.html`) will be served _without_ a trailing slash and folder index files (e.g. `foo/index.html`) will be served _with_ a trailing slash. Alternatively, you can force trailing slashes (`force-trailing-slash`) or drop trailing slashes (`drop-trailing-slash`) on requests for HTML pages.

### Custom 404 pages

Configuring `assets.not_found_handling` to `404-page` overrides the default serving behavior of Workers for static assets. When an incoming request does not match a file in the `assets.directory`, Workers will serve the contents of the nearest `404.html` file with a `404 Not Found` status.

## Local Development

If you are using a Vite-powered SPA framework, you might be interested in using our [Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/) which offers a Vite-native developer experience.

<Render
	file="static_asset_routing_reference"
	params={{ not_found_handling: "404-page" }}
/>
