description: How to configure a Worker with static assets on a subpath.

This feature requires Wrangler v3.98.0 or later.

Like with any other Worker, [you can configure a Worker with assets to run on a path of your domain](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/).
Assets defined for a Worker must be nested in a directory structure that mirrors the desired path.

For example, to serve assets from `example.com/blog/*`, create a `blog` directory in your asset directory.

<FileTree>

- dist
  - blog
    - index.html
    - posts
      - post1.html
      - post2.html

</FileTree>

With a [Wrangler configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) like so:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "assets-on-a-path-example"
main = "src/index.js"
route = "example.com/blog/*"

[assets]
directory = "dist"
```

</WranglerConfig>

In this example, requests to `example.com/blog/` will serve the `index.html` file, and requests to `example.com/blog/posts/post1` will serve the `post1.html` file.

If you have a file outside the configured path, it will not be served, unless it is part of the `assets.not_found_handling` for [Single Page Applications](/workers/static-assets/routing/single-page-application/) or [custom 404 pages](/workers/static-assets/routing/static-site-generation/). For example, if you have a `home.html` file in the root of your asset directory, it will not be served when requesting `example.com/blog/home`. However, if needed, these files can still be manually fetched over [the binding](/workers/static-assets/binding/#binding).
