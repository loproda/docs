Full-stack applications are web applications which are span both the client and server. The build process of these applications will produce a HTML files, accompanying client-side resources (e.g. JavaScript bundles, CSS stylesheets, images, fonts, etc.) and a Worker script. Data is typically fetched the Worker script at request-time and the initial page response is usually server-side rendered (SSR). From there, the client is then hydrated and a SPA-like experience ensues.

The following full-stack frameworks are natively supported by Workers:

<DirectoryListing
	folder="workers/framework-guides/web-apps"
	tag="full-stack"
/>
<DirectoryListing
	folder="workers/framework-guides/web-apps/more-web-frameworks"
	tag="full-stack"
/>
