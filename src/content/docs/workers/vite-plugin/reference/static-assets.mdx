This guide focuses on the areas of working with static assets that are unique to the Vite plugin.
For more general documentation, see [Static Assets](/workers/static-assets/).

## Configuration

The Vite plugin does not require that you provide the `assets` field in order to enable assets and instead determines whether assets should be included based on whether the `client` environment has been built. By default, the `client` environment is built if any of the following conditions are met:

- There is an `index.html` file in the root of your project
- `build.rollupOptions.input` or `environments.client.build.rollupOptions.input` is specified in your Vite config
- You have a non-empty [`public` directory](https://vite.dev/guide/assets#the-public-directory)
- Your Worker [imports assets as URLs](https://vite.dev/guide/assets#importing-asset-as-url)

On running `vite build`, an output `wrangler.json` configuration file is generated as part of the build output.
The `assets.directory` field in this file is automatically populated with the path to your `client` build output.
It is therefore not necessary to provide the `assets.directory` field in your input Worker configuration.

The `assets` configuration should be used, however, if you wish to set [routing configuration](/workers/static-assets/routing/) or enable the [assets binding](/workers/static-assets/binding/#binding).
The following example configures the `not_found_handling` for a single-page application so that the fallback will always be the root `index.html` file.

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
assets = { not_found_handling = "single-page-application" }
```

</WranglerConfig>

## Features

The Vite plugin ensures that all of Vite's [static asset handling](https://vite.dev/guide/assets) features are supported in your Worker as well as in your frontend.
These include importing assets as URLs, importing as strings and importing from the `public` directory as well as inlining assets.

Assets [imported as URLs](https://vite.dev/guide/assets#importing-asset-as-url) can be fetched via the [assets binding](/workers/static-assets/binding/#binding).
As the binding's `fetch` method requires a full URL, we recommend using the request URL as the `base`.
This is demonstrated in the following example:

```ts
import myImage from "./my-image.png";

export default {
	fetch(request, env) {
		return env.ASSETS.fetch(new URL(myImage, request.url));
	},
};
```

Assets imported as URLs in your Worker will automatically be moved to the client build output.
When running `vite build` the paths of any moved assets will be displayed in the console.

:::note
If you are developing a multi-Worker application, assets can only be accessed on the client and in your entry Worker.

## Headers and redirects

Custom [headers](/workers/static-assets/headers/) and [redirects](/workers/static-assets/redirects/) are supported at build, preview and deploy time by adding `_headers` and `_redirects` files to your [`public` directory](https://vite.dev/guide/assets#the-public-directory).
The paths in these files should reflect the structure of your client build output.
For example, generated assets are typically located in an [assets subdirectory](https://vite.dev/config/build-options#build-assetsdir).
