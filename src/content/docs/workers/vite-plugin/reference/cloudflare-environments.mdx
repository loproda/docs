A Worker config file may contain configuration for multiple [Cloudflare environments](/workers/wrangler/environments/).
With the Cloudflare Vite plugin, you select a Cloudflare environment at dev or build time by providing the `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` environment variable.
Consider the following example Worker config file:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "my-worker"
compatibility_date = "2025-04-03"
main = "./src/index.ts"

vars = { MY_VAR = "Top-level var" }

[env.staging]
vars = { MY_VAR = "Staging var" }

[env.production]
vars = { MY_VAR = "Production var" }
```

</WranglerConfig>

If you run `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production vite build` then the output `wrangler.json` file generated by the build will be a flattened configuration for the 'production' Cloudflare environment, as shown in the following example:

```json title=dist/wrangler.json
{
	"name": "my-worker",
	"compatibility_date": "2025-04-03",
	"main": "index.js",
	"vars": { "MY_VAR": "Production var" }
}
```

Notice that the value of `MY_VAR` is `Production var`.
This flattened configuration combines [top-level only](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#top-level-only-keys), [inheritable](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#inheritable-keys), and [non-inheritable](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#non-inheritable-keys) keys.

:::note
The default Vite environment name for a Worker is always the top-level Worker name.
This enables you to reference the Worker consistently in your Vite config when using multiple Cloudflare environments.
See [Vite Environments](/workers/vite-plugin/reference/vite-environments/) for more information.
:::

Cloudflare environments can also be used in development.
For example, you could run `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=development vite dev`.
It is common to use the default top-level environment as the development environment and then add additional environments as necessary.

:::note
Running `vite dev` or `vite build` without providing `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` will use the default top-level Cloudflare environment.
As Cloudflare environments are applied at dev and build time, specifying `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` when running `vite preview` or `wrangler deploy` will have no effect.

## Combining Cloudflare environments and Vite modes

You may wish to combine the concepts of [Cloudflare environments](/workers/wrangler/environments/) and [Vite modes](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#modes).
With this approach, the Vite mode can be used to select the Cloudflare environment and a single method can be used to determine environment specific configuration and code.
Consider again the previous example:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
# wrangler.toml

name = "my-worker"
compatibility_date = "2025-04-03"
main = "./src/index.ts"

vars = { MY_VAR = "Top-level var" }

[env.staging]
vars = { MY_VAR = "Staging var" }

[env.production]
vars = { MY_VAR = "Production var" }
```

</WranglerConfig>

Next, provide `.env.staging` and `.env.production` files:

```sh title=".env.staging"
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=staging
```

```sh title=".env.production"
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production
```

By default, `vite build` uses the 'production' Vite mode.
Vite will therefore load the `.env.production` file to get the environment variables that are used in the build.
Since the `.env.production` file contains `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production`, the Cloudflare Vite plugin will select the 'production' Cloudflare environment.
The value of `MY_VAR` will therefore be `'Production var'`.
If you run `vite build --mode staging` then the 'staging' Vite mode will be used and the 'staging' Cloudflare environment will be selected.
The value of `MY_VAR` will therefore be `'Staging var'`.

For more information about using `.env` files with Vite, see the [relevant documentation](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode#env-files).
