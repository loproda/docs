Cloud Interconnect allows you to connect your virtual private cloud (VPC) virtual networks directly with Cloudflare â€” for a more reliable and secure experience.

Connecting to Cloudflare directly with a Cloud Interconnect reduces latency, makes your network more stable by bypassing Internet performance potential bottlenecks, and will often reduce your cloud provider network egress bandwidth charges. The use case for Cloud Interconnect is Magic WAN.

## Supported cloud providers

Cloudflare supports interconnect with:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) Direct Connect
- Google Cloud (GCP) Interconnect

Azure ExpressRoute support is coming soon.

## Cloud Interconnect Setup

To create a new cloud interconnect, contact your customer success manager to get started with the set up.
