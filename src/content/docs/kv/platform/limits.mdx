[^1]: Within a single invocation, a Worker can make up to 1,000 operations to external services (for example, 500 Workers KV reads and 500 R2 reads). A bulk request to Workers KV counts for 1 request to an external service.

[^2]: The maximum value is [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).
