<GlossaryTooltip term="Durable Object">Durable Objects</GlossaryTooltip> are a powerful compute API that provides a compute with storage building block. Each Durable Object has its own private, transactional, and strongly consistent storage. Durable Objects <GlossaryTooltip term="Storage API">Storage API</GlossaryTooltip> provides access to a Durable Object's attached storage.

A Durable Object's [in-memory state](/durable-objects/reference/in-memory-state/) is preserved as long as the Durable Object is not evicted from memory. Inactive Durable Objects with no incoming request traffic can be evicted. There are normal operations like [code deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/) that trigger Durable Objects to restart and lose their in-memory state. For these reasons, you should use Storage API to persist state durably on disk that needs to survive eviction or restart of Durable Objects.

## Access storage

<Render file="recommend-sqlite-do" product="durable-objects"/>

<Render file="do-sqlite-storage-no-bill-note"/>

[Storage API methods](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#methods) are available on `ctx.storage` parameter passed to the Durable Object constructor. Storage API has several methods, including SQL, point-in-time recovery (PITR), key-value (KV), and alarm APIs.

Only Durable Object classes with a SQLite storage backend can access SQL API.

### Create SQLite-backed Durable Object class

Use `new_sqlite_classes` on the migration in your Worker's Wrangler file:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1" # Should be unique for each entry
new_sqlite_classes = ["MyDurableObject"] # Array of new classes
```

</WranglerConfig>

[SQL API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#exec) is available on `ctx.storage.sql` parameter passed to the Durable Object constructor.

SQLite-backed Durable Objects also offer [point-in-time recovery API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#pitr-point-in-time-recovery-api), which uses <GlossaryTooltip term="bookmark">bookmarks</GlossaryTooltip> to allow you to restore a Durable Object's embedded SQLite database to any point in time in the past 30 days.

### Initialize instance variables from storage

A common pattern is to initialize a Durable Object from [persistent storage](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/) and set instance variables the first time it is accessed. Since future accesses are routed to the same Durable Object, it is then possible to return any initialized values without making further calls to persistent storage.

```ts
import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";

export class Counter extends DurableObject {
  value: number;

  constructor(ctx: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(ctx, env);

    // `blockConcurrencyWhile()` ensures no requests are delivered until
    // initialization completes.
    ctx.blockConcurrencyWhile(async () => {
      // After initialization, future reads do not need to access storage.
      this.value = (await ctx.storage.get("value")) || 0;
    });
  }

  async getCounterValue() {
    return this.value;
  }
}
```

### Remove a Durable Object's storage

A Durable Object fully ceases to exist if, when it shuts down, its storage is empty. If you never write to a Durable Object's storage at all (including setting <GlossaryTooltip term="alarm">alarms</GlossaryTooltip>), then storage remains empty, and so the Durable Object will no longer exist once it shuts down.

However if you ever write using [Storage API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/), including setting alarms, then you must explicitly call [`storage.deleteAll()`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#deleteall) to empty storage and [`storage.deleteAlarm()`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#deletealarm) if you've configured an alarm. It is not sufficient to simply delete the specific data that you wrote, such as deleting a key or dropping a table, as some metadata may remain. The only way to remove all storage is to call `deleteAll()`. Calling `deleteAll()` ensures that a Durable Object will not be billed for storage.

```ts
export class MyDurableObject extends DurableObject<Env> {

  constructor(ctx: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(ctx, env);
  }

  // Clears Durable Object storage
  async clearDo():Promise<void> {
    // If you've configured a Durable Object alarm
    await this.ctx.storage.deleteAlarm();

    // This will delete all the storage associated with this Durable Object instance
    // This will also delete the Durable Object instance itself
    await this.ctx.storage.deleteAll();
  }
}
```

## SQL API Examples

<Render file="durable-objects-sql" />

## TypeScript and query results

You can use TypeScript [type parameters](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html#working-with-generic-type-variables) to provide a type for your results, allowing you to benefit from type hints and checks when iterating over the results of a query.

:::caution

Providing a type parameter does _not_ validate that the query result matches your type definition. In TypeScript, properties (fields) that do not exist in your result type will be silently dropped.

:::

Your type must conform to the shape of a TypeScript [Record](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type) type representing the name (`string`) of the column and the type of the column. The column type must be a valid `SqlStorageValue`: one of `ArrayBuffer | string | number | null`.

For example,

```ts
type User = {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	email_address: string;
	version: number;
}
```

This type can then be passed as the type parameter to a `sql.exec()` call:

```ts
// The type parameter is passed between angle brackets before the function argument:
const result = this.ctx.storage.sql.exec<User>("SELECT id, name, email_address, version FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id).one()
// result will now have a type of "User"

// Alternatively, if you are iterating over results using a cursor
let cursor = this.sql.exec<User>("SELECT id, name, email_address, version FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
for (let row of cursor) {
	// Each row object will be of type User
}

// Or, if you are using raw() to convert results into an array, define an array type:
type UserRow = [
  id: string,
  name: string,
  email_address: string,
  version: number,
];

// ... and then pass it as the type argument to the raw() method:
let cursor = sql.exec("SELECT id, name, email_address, version FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id).raw<UserRow>();

for (let row of cursor) {
	// row is of type User
}
```

You can represent the shape of any result type you wish, including more complex types. If you are performing a
`JOIN` across multiple tables, you can compose a type that reflects the results of your queries.

## Indexes in SQLite

Creating indexes for your most queried tables and filtered columns reduces how much data is scanned and improves query performance at the same time. If you have a read-heavy workload (most common), this can be particularly advantageous. Writing to columns referenced in an index will add at least one (1) additional row written to account for updating the index, but this is typically offset by the reduction in rows read due to the benefits of an index.
