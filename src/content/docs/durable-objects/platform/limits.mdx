Durable Objects are a special kind of Worker, so [Workers Limits](/workers/platform/limits/) apply according to your Workers plan. In addition, Durable Objects have specific limits as listed in this page.

## SQLite-backed Durable Objects general limits

| Feature                                  | Limit |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of Objects                        | Unlimited (within an account or of a given class)           |
| Maximum Durable Object classes           | 500 (Workers Paid) / 100 (Free) [^1]                        |
| Storage per account                      | Unlimited (Workers Paid) / 5GB (Free) [^2]                  |
| Storage per class                        | Unlimited [^3]                                              |
| Storage per Durable Object               | 10 GB [^3]                                                  |
| Key size                                 | Key and value combined cannot exceed 2 MB                   |
| Value size                               | Key and value combined cannot exceed 2 MB                   |
| WebSocket message size                   | 1 MiB (only for received messages)                          |
| CPU per request                          | 30 seconds (default) / configurable to 5 minutes of [active CPU time](/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time) [^4] |

[^1]: Identical to the Workers [script limit](/workers/platform/limits/).
[^2]: Durable Objects both bills and measures storage based on a gigabyte <br/> (1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes) and not a gibibyte (GiB). <br/>
[^3]: Accounts on the Workers Free plan are limited to 5 GB total Durable Objects storage.
[^4]: Each incoming HTTP request or WebSocket *message* resets the remaining available CPU time to 30 seconds. This allows the Durable Object to consume up to 30 seconds of compute after each incoming network request, with each new network request resetting the timer. If you consume more than 30 seconds of compute between incoming network requests, there is a heightened chance that the individual Durable Object is evicted and reset. CPU time per request invocation [can be increased](/durable-objects/platform/limits/#increasing-durable-object-cpu-limits).

### SQL storage limits

For Durable Object classes with [SQLite storage](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#sql-storage) these SQL limits apply:

| SQL                                                      | Limit                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Maximum number of columns per table                      | 100                                             |
| Maximum number of rows per table                         | Unlimited (excluding per-object storage limits) |
| Maximum string, `BLOB` or table row size                 | 2 MB                                            |
| Maximum SQL statement length                             | 100 KB                                          |
| Maximum bound parameters per query                       | 100                                             |
| Maximum arguments per SQL function                       | 32                                              |
| Maximum characters (bytes) in a `LIKE` or `GLOB` pattern | 50 bytes                                        |
