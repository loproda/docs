After configuring one or multiple rule types in Magic Network Monitoring, customers can also choose to receive notifications via email, webhook, or PagerDuty when a rule is triggered.

Customers can configure multiple rule types and alerts together to create layers of DDoS protection based on their network environment and their security needs.
