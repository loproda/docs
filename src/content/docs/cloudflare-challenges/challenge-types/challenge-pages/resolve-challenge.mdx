If a visitor encounters a Challenge, Cloudflare employees cannot remove that Challenge. Only the website owner can configure their Cloudflare settings to stop the Challenge being presented.

When observing a Cloudflare Challenge page, a visitor could:

- Successfully pass the Challenge to visit the website.
- Request the website owner to allow their IP address.
- Scan their computer for malicious programs (it may be infected).
- Check their antivirus or firewall service to make sure it is not blocking access to the Challenge resources (for example, images).

:::note
Visitors must enable JavaScript and cookies on their browser to be able to pass any type of Challenge.
