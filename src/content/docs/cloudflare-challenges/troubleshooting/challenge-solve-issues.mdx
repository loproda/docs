## Challenge loops

You may encounter a Challenge loop where the Challenge keeps reappearing without being solved. This is in very specific cases where we detect strong bot signals. If you are a legitimate human, you can follow the troubleshooting guide below to resolve the issue or submit a feedback report. Challenge loops can happen for several reasons:

- **Network issues**: Poor or unstable network connections can prevent the Challenge from being completed.
- **Browser configuration**: Some browser settings or extensions may block the scripts needed to execute the Challenge.
- **Unsupported browsers**: Using a browser that is not supported by Turnstile.
- **JavaScript disabled**: Turnstile relies on JavaScript to function properly.
- **Detection errors**: If Turnstile suspects bot-like behavior, you may encounter repeated Challenges for verification.

Most Challenges are quick to complete and typically take only a few seconds. If it takes longer, ensure your network is stable and follow the [troubleshooting steps](#troubleshooting).

:::note
If the issue persists, try switching to a different network or device to rule out any issues with your browser environment.

Ensure your browser is updated to the latest version to maintain compatibility.
