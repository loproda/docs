You can draw additional images on top of a resized image, with transparency and blending effects. This enables adding of watermarks, logos, signatures, vignettes, and other effects to resized images.

This feature is available only in [Workers](/images/transform-images/transform-via-workers/). To draw overlay images, add an array of drawing commands to options of `fetch()` requests. The drawing options are nested in `options.cf.image.draw`, like in the following example:

```js
fetch(imageURL, {
  cf: {
    image: {
      width: 800,
      height: 600,
      draw: [
        {
          url: 'https://example.com/branding/logo.png', // draw this image
          bottom: 5, // 5 pixels from the bottom edge
          right: 5, // 5 pixels from the right edge
          fit: 'contain', // make it fit within 100x50 area
          width: 100,
          height: 50,
          opacity: 0.8, // 20% transparent
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

## Draw options

The `draw` property is an array. Overlays are drawn in the order they appear in the array (the last array entry is the topmost layer). Each item in the `draw` array is an object, which can have the following properties:



* `url`
  * Absolute URL of the image file to use for the drawing. It can be any of the supported file formats. For drawing watermarks or non-rectangular overlays, Cloudflare recommends that you use PNG or WebP images.

* `width` and `height`
  * Maximum size of the overlay image, in pixels. It must be an integer.

* `fit` and `gravity`
  * Affects interpretation of `width` and `height`. Same as [for the main image](/images/transform-images/transform-via-workers/#fetch-options).

* `opacity`
  * Floating-point number between `0` (transparent) and `1` (opaque). For example, `opacity: 0.5` makes overlay semitransparent.

* `repeat`
  * If set to `true`, the overlay image will be tiled to cover the entire area. This is useful for stock-photo-like watermarks.
  * If set to `"x"`, the overlay image will be tiled horizontally only (form a line).
  * If set to `"y"`, the overlay image will be tiled vertically only (form a line).

* `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`
  * Position of the overlay image relative to a given edge. Each property is an offset in pixels. `0` aligns exactly to the edge. For example, `left: 10` positions left side of the overlay 10 pixels from the left edge of the image it is drawn over. `bottom: 0` aligns bottom of the overlay with bottom of the background image.

    Setting both `left` and `right`, or both `top` and `bottom` is an error.

    If no position is specified, the image will be centered.

* `background`
  * Background color to add underneath the overlay image. Same as [for the main image](/images/transform-images/transform-via-workers/#fetch-options).

* `rotate`
  * Number of degrees to rotate the overlay image by. Same as [for the main image](/images/transform-images/transform-via-workers/#fetch-options).

## Draw using the Images binding

When [interacting with Images through a binding](/images/transform-images/bindings/), the Images API supports a `.draw()` method.

The accepted options for the overlaid image are `opacity`, `repeat`, `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right`.

```js
// Fetch image and watermark
const img = await fetch('https://example.com/image.png');
const watermark = await fetch('https://example.com/watermark.png');

const response = await env.IMAGES.input(img.body)
  .transform({ width: 1024 })
  .draw(watermark.body, { "opacity": 0.25, "repeat": true })
  .output({ format: "image/avif" })
  .response();

return response;
```

To apply [parameters](/images/transform-images/transform-via-workers/) to the overlaid image, you can pass a child `.transform()` function inside the `.draw()` request.

In the example below, the watermark is manipulated with `rotate` and `width` before being drawn over the base image with the `opacity` and `rotate` options.

```js
// Fetch image and watermark
const response = (
  await env.IMAGES.input(img.body)
    .transform({ width: 1024 })
    .draw(watermark.body, { "opacity": 0.25, "repeat": true })
    .output({ format: "image/avif" })
).response();
```

## Examples

### Stock Photo Watermark

```js
image: {
  draw: [
    {
      url: 'https://example.com/watermark.png',
      repeat: true, // Tiled over entire image
      opacity: 0.2, // and subtly blended
    },
  ];
}
```

### Signature

```js
image: {
  draw: [
    {
      url: 'https://example.com/by-me.png', // Predefined logo/signature
      bottom: 5, // Positioned near bottom right corner
      right: 5,
    },
  ];
}
```

### Centered icon

```js
image: {
  draw: [
    {
      url: 'https://example.com/play-button.png',
      // Center position is the default
    },
  ];
}
```

### Combined

Multiple operations can be combined in one image:

```js
image: {
  draw: [
    { url: 'https://example.com/watermark.png', repeat: true, opacity: 0.2 },
    { url: 'https://example.com/play-button.png' },
    { url: 'https://example.com/by-me.png', bottom: 5, right: 5 },
  ];
}
```
