With upgraded limits to [all free and paid plans](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/), you can now scale more easily with [Cloudflare for SaaS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/) and [Secrets Store](https://developers.cloudflare.com/secrets-store/).

[Cloudflare for SaaS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/) allows you to extend the benefits of Cloudflare to your customers via their own custom or vanity domains. Now, the [limit for custom hostnames](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/plans/) on a Cloudflare for SaaS pay-as-you-go plan has been **raised from 5,000 custom hostnames to 50,000 custom hostnames.**

With custom origin server -- previously an enterprise-only feature -- you can route traffic from one or more custom hostnames somewhere other than your default proxy fallback. [Custom origin server](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/custom-origin/) is now available to Cloudflare for SaaS customers on Free, Pro, and Business plans.

You can enable custom origin server on a per-custom hostname basis [via the API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/custom_hostnames/methods/edit/) or the UI:
