After you triage your users' submissions (that are machine reviewed), you can now escalate them to our team for reclassification (which are instead human reviewed). User submissions from the submission alias, PhishNet, and our API can all be escalated.

From **Reclassifications**, go to **User submissions**. Select the three dots next to any of the user submissions, then select **Escalate** to create a team request for reclassification. The Cloudflare dashboard will then show you the submissions on the **Team Submissions** tab. 

Refer to [User submissions](/cloudflare-one/email-security/email-monitoring/search-email/#user-submissions) to learn more about this feature. 

This feature is available across these Email Security packages: 

-  **Advantage** 
-  **Enterprise** 
-  **Enterprise + PhishGuard**
