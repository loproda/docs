Cloudflare Email Security customers who have Microsoft 365 environments can quickly deploy an Email DLP (Data Loss Prevention) solution for free. 

Simply deploy our add-in, create a DLP policy in Cloudflare, and configure Outlook to trigger behaviors like displaying a banner, alerting end users before sending, or preventing delivery entirely. 

Refer to [Outbound Data Loss Prevention](/cloudflare-one/email-security/outbound-dlp/) to learn more about this feature.
