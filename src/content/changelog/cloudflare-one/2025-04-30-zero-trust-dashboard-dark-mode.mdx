The [Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) now supports Cloudflare's native dark mode for all accounts and plan types.

Zero Trust Dashboard will automatically accept your user-level preferences for system settings, so if your Dashboard appearance is set to 'system' or 'dark', the Zero Trust dashboard will enter dark mode whenever the rest of your Cloudflare account does.
