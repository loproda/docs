Cloudflare Zero Trust customers can use the App Library to get full visibility over the SaaS applications that they use in their Gateway policies, CASB integrations, and Access for SaaS applications.

**App Library**, found under **My Team**, makes information available about all Applications that can be used across the Zero Trust product suite.

You can use the App Library to see:

- How Applications are defined
- Where they are referenced in policies
- Whether they have Access for SaaS configured
- Review their CASB findings and integration status.

Within individual Applications, you can also track their usage across your organization, and better understand user behavior.
