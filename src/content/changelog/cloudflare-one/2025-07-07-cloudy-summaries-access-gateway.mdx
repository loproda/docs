Cloudy, Cloudflare's AI Agent, will now automatically summarize your [Access](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/audit-logs/) and [Gateway](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/gateway-logs/) block logs.

In the log itself, Cloudy will summarize what occurred and why. This will be helpful for quick troubleshooting and issue correlation.

If you have feedback about the Cloudy summary - good or bad - you can provide that right from the summary itself.
