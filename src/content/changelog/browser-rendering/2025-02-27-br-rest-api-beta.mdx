We've released a new REST API for [Browser Rendering](/browser-rendering/) in open beta, making interacting with browsers easier than ever. This new API provides endpoints for common browser actions, with more to be added in the future.

With the **REST API** you can:

- **Capture screenshots** – Use `/screenshot` to take a screenshot of a webpage from provided URL or HTML.
- **Generate PDFs** – Use `/pdf` to convert web pages into PDFs.
- **Extract HTML content** – Use `/content` to retrieve the full HTML from a page.
  **Snapshot (HTML + Screenshot)** – Use `/snapshot` to capture both the page's HTML and a screenshot in one request
- **Scrape Web Elements** – Use `/scrape` to extract specific elements from a page.

For example, to capture a screenshot:

```bash title="Screenshot example"
curl -X POST 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<accountId>/browser-rendering/screenshot' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <apiToken>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "html": "Hello World!",
    "screenshotOptions": {
      "type": "webp",
      "omitBackground": true
    }
  }' \
  --output "screenshot.webp"
```
