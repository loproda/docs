Cloudflare is removing five fields from the `meta` object of DNS records. These fields have been unused for more than a year and are no longer set on new records. This change may take up to four weeks to fully roll out.

The affected fields are:

- the `auto_added` boolean
- the `managed_by_apps` boolean and corresponding `apps_install_id`
- the `managed_by_argo_tunnel` boolean and corresponding `argo_tunnel_id`

An example record returned from the API would now look like the following:

```json title="Updated API Response" del={14-16}
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<ID>",
		"zone_id": "<ZONE_ID>",
		"zone_name": "example.com",
		"name": "www.example.com",
		"type": "A",
		"content": "192.0.2.1",
		"proxiable": true,
		"proxied": false,
		"ttl": 1,
		"locked": false,
		"meta": {
			"auto_added": false,
			"managed_by_apps": false,
			"managed_by_argo_tunnel": false,
			"source": "primary"
		},
		"comment": null,
		"tags": [],
		"created_on": "2025-03-17T20:37:05.368097Z",
		"modified_on": "2025-03-17T20:37:05.368097Z"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```
