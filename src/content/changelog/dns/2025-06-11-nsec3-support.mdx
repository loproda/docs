Enterprise customers can now select NSEC3 as method for proof of non-existence on their zones.

What's new:

- **NSEC3 support for live-signed zones** – For both primary and secondary zones that are configured to be live-signed (also known as "on-the-fly signing"), NSEC3 can now be selected as proof of non-existence.

- **NSEC3 support for pre-signed zones** – Secondary zones that are transferred to Cloudflare in a [pre-signed setup](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/dnssec-for-secondary/#set-up-pre-signed-dnssec) now also support NSEC3 as proof of non-existence.

For more information and how to enable NSEC3, refer to the [NSEC3 documentation](/dns/dnssec/enable-nsec3/).
