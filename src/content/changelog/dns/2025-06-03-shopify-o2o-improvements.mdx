Shopify merchants can now onboard to **Orange-to-Orange (O2O)** automatically, without needing to contact support or community members.

What's new:

- **Automatic enablement** – O2O is available for all mutual Cloudflare and Shopify customers.

- **Branded record display** – Merchants see a Shopify logo in DNS records, complete with helpful tooltips.

- **Checkout protection** – Workers and Snippets are blocked from running on the checkout path to reduce risk and improve security.

For more information, refer to the [provider guide](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/provider-guides/shopify/).
