Authoritative DNS analytics are now available on the **account level** via the [Cloudflare GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/).

This allows users to query DNS analytics across multiple zones in their account, by using the `accounts` filter.

Here is an example to retrieve the most recent DNS queries across all zones in your account that resulted in an `NXDOMAIN` response over a given time frame. Please replace `a30f822fcd7c401984bf85d8f2a5111c` with your actual account ID.

```graphql graphql-api-explorer title="GraphQL example for account-level DNS analytics"
query GetLatestNXDOMAINResponses {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: "a30f822fcd7c401984bf85d8f2a5111c" }) {
			dnsAnalyticsAdaptive(
				filter: {
					date_geq: "2025-06-16"
					date_leq: "2025-06-18"
					responseCode: "NXDOMAIN"
				}
				limit: 10000
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				zoneTag
				queryName
				responseCode
				queryType
				datetime
			}
		}
	}
}
```
