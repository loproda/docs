[**Radar**](/radar/) now introduces Certificate Transparency (CT) insights, providing visibility into certificate issuance trends based on Certificate Transparency logs currently monitored by Cloudflare.

The following API endpoints are now available:

- [`/ct/timeseries`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/ct/methods/timeseries/): Retrieves certificate issuance time series.
- [`/ct/summary/{dimension}`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/ct/methods/summary/): Retrieves certificate distribution by dimension.
- [`/ct/timeseries_groups/{dimension}`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/ct/methods/timeseries_groups/): Retrieves time series of certificate distribution by dimension.
- [`/ct/authorities`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/ct/subresources/authorities/methods/list/): Lists certification authorities.
- [`/ct/authorities/{ca_slug}`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/ct/subresources/authorities/methods/get/): Retrieves details about a Certification Authority (CA). CA information is derived from the [Common CA Database (CCADB)](https://www.ccadb.org/).
- [`/ct/logs`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/ct/subresources/logs/methods/list/): Lists CT logs.
- [`/ct/logs/{log_slug}`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/ct/subresources/logs/methods/get/): Retrieves details about a CT log. CT log information is derived from the [Google Chrome log list](https://googlechrome.github.io/CertificateTransparency/log_lists.html).

For the `summary` and `timeseries_groups` endpoints, the following dimensions are available (and also usable as filters):

- `ca`: Certification Authority (certificate issuer)
- `ca_owner`: Certification Authority Owner
- `duration`: Certificate validity duration (between NotBefore and NotAfter dates)
- `entry_type`: Entry type (certificate vs. pre-certificate)
- `expiration_status`: Expiration status (valid vs. expired)
- `has_ips`: Presence of IP addresses in certificate [Subject Alternative Names (SANs)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/#hostname-and-wildcard-coverage)
- `has_wildcards`: Presence of wildcard DNS names in certificate SANs
- `log`: CT log name
- `log_api`: CT log API ([RFC6962](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962) vs. [Static](https://c2sp.org/static-ct-api))
- `log_operator`: CT log operator
- `public_key_algorithm`: Public key algorithm of certificate's key
- `signature_algorithm`: Signature algorithm used by CA to sign certificate
- `tld`: Top-level domain for DNS names found in certificates SANs
- `validation_level`: [Validation level](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/types-of-ssl-certificates/)
