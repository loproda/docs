[**Radar**](/radar/) has expanded its security insights, providing visibility into aggregate trends in authentication requests,
including the detection of leaked credentials through [leaked credentials detection](/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/) scans.

We have now introduced the following endpoints:

- [`/leaked_credential_checks/summary/{dimension}`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/leaked_credentials/subresources/summary/): Retrieves summaries of HTTP authentication requests distribution across two different dimensions.
- [`/leaked_credential_checks/timeseries_groups/{dimension}`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/leaked_credentials/subresources/timeseries_groups/): Retrieves timeseries data for HTTP authentication requests distribution across two different dimensions.

The following dimensions are available, displaying the distribution of HTTP authentication requests based on:

- `compromised`: Credential status (clean vs. compromised).
- `bot_class`: [Bot class](/radar/concepts/bot-classes) (human vs. bot).
