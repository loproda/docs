[**Radar**](/radar/) has expanded its DNS insights, providing visibility into aggregated traffic and usage trends observed by our [1.1.1.1](/1.1.1.1/) DNS resolver.
In addition to global, location, and ASN traffic trends, we are also providing perspectives on protocol usage, query/response characteristics, and DNSSEC usage.

Previously limited to the [`top`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/dns/subresources/top/) locations and ASes endpoints, we have now introduced the following endpoints:

- [`/dns/timeseries`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/dns/methods/timeseries/): Retrieves DNS query volume over time.
- [`/dns/summary/{dimension}`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/dns/subresources/summary/): Retrieves summaries of DNS query distribution across ten different dimensions.
- [`/dns/timeseries_groups/{dimension}`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/dns/subresources/timeseries_groups/): Retrieves timeseries data for DNS query distribution across ten different dimensions.

For the `summary` and `timeseries_groups` endpoints, the following dimensions are available, displaying the distribution of DNS queries based on:

- `cache_hit`: Cache status (hit vs. miss).
- `dnsssec`: DNSSEC support status (secure, insecure, invalid or other).
- `dnsssec_aware`: DNSSEC client awareness (aware vs. not-aware).
- `dnsssec_e2e`: End-to-end security (secure vs. insecure).
- `ip_version`: IP version (IPv4 vs. IPv6).
- `matching_answer`: Matching answer status (match vs. no-match).
- `protocol`: Transport protocol (UDP, TLS, HTTPS or TCP).
- `query_type`: Query type (`A`, `AAAA`, `PTR`, etc.).
- `response_code`: Response code (`NOERROR`, `NXDOMAIN`, `REFUSED`, etc.).
- `response_ttl`: Response TTL.
