You can now publish messages to [Cloudflare Queues](/queues/) directly via HTTP from any service or programming language that supports sending HTTP requests. Previously, publishing to queues was only possible from within [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). You can already consume from queues via Workers or [HTTP pull consumers](/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/), and now publishing is just as flexible.

Publishing via HTTP requires a [Cloudflare API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with `Queues Edit` permissions for authentication. Here's a simple example:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/queues/<queue_id>/messages" \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
  --data '{ "body": { "greeting": "hello", "timestamp":  "2025-07-24T12:00:00Z"} }'
```

You can also use our [SDKs](/fundamentals/api/reference/sdks/) for TypeScript, Python, and Go.

To get started with HTTP publishing, check out our [step-by-step example](/queues/examples/publish-to-a-queue-via-http/) and the full API documentation in our [API reference](/api/resources/queues/subresources/messages/methods/push/).
