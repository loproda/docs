[Queues](/queues/) now supports the ability to pause message delivery and/or purge (delete) messages on a queue. These operations can be useful when:

* Your consumer has a bug or downtime, and you want to temporarily stop messages from being processed while you fix the bug
* You have pushed invalid messages to a queue due to a code change during development, and you want to clean up the backlog
* Your queue has a backlog that is stale and you want to clean it up to allow new messages to be consumed

To pause a queue using [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/), run the `pause-delivery` command. Paused queues continue to receive messages. And you can easily unpause a queue using the `resume-delivery` command.
```bash title="Pause and resume a queue"
$ wrangler queues pause-delivery my-queue
Pausing message delivery for queue my-queue.
Paused message delivery for queue my-queue.

$ wrangler queues resume-delivery my-queue
Resuming message delivery for queue my-queue.
Resumed message delivery for queue my-queue.
```

Purging a queue permanently deletes all messages in the queue. Unlike pausing, purging is an irreversible operation:
```bash title="Purge a queue"
$ wrangler queues purge my-queue
✔ This operation will permanently delete all the messages in queue my-queue. Type my-queue to proceed. … my-queue
Purged queue 'my-queue'
```

You can also do these operations using the [Queues REST API](/api/resources/queues/), or the dashboard page for a queue.

This feature is available on all new and existing queues. Head over to the [pause and purge documentation](/queues/configuration/pause-purge) to learn more. And if you haven't used Cloudflare Queues before, [get started with the Cloudflare Queues guide](/queues/get-started).
