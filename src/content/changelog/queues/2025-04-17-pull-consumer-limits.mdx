[Queues pull consumers](/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) can now pull and acknowledge up to **5,000 messages / second per queue**. Previously, pull consumers were rate limited to 1,200 requests / 5 minutes, aggregated across all queues.

Pull consumers allow you to consume messages over HTTP from any environment—including outside of [Cloudflare Workers](/workers). They’re also useful when you need fine-grained control over how quickly messages are consumed.

To setup a new queue with a pull based consumer using [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/), run:
```sh title="Create a queue with a pull based consumer"
npx wrangler queues create my-queue
npx wrangler queues consumer http add my-queue
```
You can also configure a pull consumer using the [REST API](/api/resources/queues/subresources/consumers/methods/create/) or the Queues dashboard.

Once configured, you can pull messages from the queue using any HTTP client. You'll need a [Cloudflare API Token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with `queues_read` and `queues_write` permissions. For example:
```bash title="Pull messages from a queue"
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${CF_ACCOUNT_ID}/queues/${QUEUE_ID}/messages/pull" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{ "visibility_timeout": 10000, "batch_size": 2 }'
```

To learn more about how to acknowledge messages, pull batches at once, and setup multiple consumers, refer to the [pull consumer documentation](/queues/configuration/pull-consumers).

As always, Queues doesn't charge for data egress. Pull operations continue to be billed at the [existing rate](/queues/platform/pricing), of $0.40 / million operations. The increased limits are available now, on all new and existing queues. If you're new to Queues, [get started with the Cloudflare Queues guide](/queues/get-started).
