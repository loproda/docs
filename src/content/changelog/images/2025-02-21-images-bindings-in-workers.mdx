import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

You can now [interact with the Images API](/images/transform-images/bindings/) directly in your Worker.

This allows more fine-grained control over transformation request flows and cache behavior. For example, you can resize, manipulate, and overlay images without requiring them to be accessible through a URL.

The Images binding can be configured in the Cloudflare dashboard for your Worker or in the `wrangler.toml` file in your project's directory:

<WranglerConfig>

```jsonc
{
	"images": {
		"binding": "IMAGES", // i.e. available in your Worker on env.IMAGES
	},
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

Within your Worker code, you can interact with this binding by using `env.IMAGES`.

Here's how you can rotate, resize, and blur an image, then output the image as AVIF:

```ts
const info = await env.IMAGES.info(stream);
// stream contains a valid image, and width/height is available on the info object

const response = (
	await env.IMAGES.input(stream)
		.transform({ rotate: 90 })
		.transform({ width: 128 })
		.transform({ blur: 20 })
		.output({ format: "image/avif" })
).response();

return response;
```
