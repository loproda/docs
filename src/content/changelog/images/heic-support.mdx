You can use Images to ingest HEIC images and serve them in supported output formats like AVIF, WebP, JPEG, and PNG.

When inputting a HEIC image, dimension and sizing limits may still apply. Refer to our documentation to see limits for [uploading to Images](/images/upload-images/) or [transforming a remote image](/images/transform-images/).
