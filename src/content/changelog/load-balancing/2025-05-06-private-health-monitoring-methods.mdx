Cloudflare Load Balancing now supports **UDP (Layer 4)** and **ICMP (Layer 3)** health monitors for **private endpoints**. This makes it simple to track the health and availability of internal services that donâ€™t respond to HTTP, TCP, or other protocol probes.

### What you can do:

- Set up **ICMP ping monitors** to check if your private endpoints are reachable.
- Use **UDP monitors** for lightweight health checks on non-TCP workloads, such as DNS, VoIP, or custom UDP-based services.
- Gain better visibility and uptime guarantees for services running behind **Private Network Load Balancing**, without requiring public IP addresses.

This enhancement is ideal for internal applications that rely on low-level protocols, especially when used in conjunction with [**Cloudflare Tunnel**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/), [**WARP**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/), and [**Magic WAN**](/magic-wan/) to create a secure and observable private network.
