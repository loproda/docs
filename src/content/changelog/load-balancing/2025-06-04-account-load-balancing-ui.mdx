description: You can now manage all of your load balancers in one place with the new Load Balancing UI.

We've made two large changes to load balancing:
- Redesigned the user interface, now centralized at the **account level**.
- Introduced [**Private Load Balancers**](/load-balancing/private-network/) to the UI, enabling you to manage traffic for all of your external and internal applications in a single spot.

This update streamlines how you manage load balancers across multiple zones and extends robust traffic management to your private network infrastructure.

**Key Enhancements:**

- **Account-Level UI Consolidation:**

  - **Unified Management:** Say goodbye to navigating individual zones for load balancing tasks. You can now view, configure, and monitor all your load balancers across every zone in your account from a single, intuitive interface at the account level.

  - **Improved Efficiency:** This centralized approach provides a more streamlined workflow, making it faster and easier to manage both your public-facing and internal traffic distribution.

- **Private Network Load Balancing:**

  - **Secure Internal Application Access:** Create [**Private Load Balancers**](/load-balancing/private-network/) to distribute traffic to applications hosted within your private network, ensuring they are not exposed to the public Internet.

  - **WARP & Magic WAN Integration:** Effortlessly direct internal traffic from users connected via Cloudflare WARP or through your Magic WAN infrastructure to the appropriate internal endpoint pools.

  - **Enhanced Security for Internal Resources:** Combine reliable Load Balancing with Zero Trust access controls to ensure your internal services are both performant and only accessible by verified users.
