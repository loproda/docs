[Workflows](/workflows/) is now _Generally Available_ (or "GA"): in short, it's ready for production workloads. Alongside marking Workflows as GA, we've introduced a number of changes during the beta period, including:

* A new `waitForEvent` API that allows a Workflow to wait for an event to occur before continuing execution.
* Increased concurrency: you can [run up to 4,500 Workflow instances](/changelog/2025-02-25-workflows-concurrency-increased/) concurrently â€” and this will continue to grow.
* Improved observability, including new CPU time metrics that allow you to better understand which Workflow instances are consuming the most resources and/or contributing to your bill.
* Support for `vitest` for testing Workflows locally and in CI/CD pipelines.

Workflows also supports the new [increased CPU limits](/changelog/2025-03-25-higher-cpu-limits/) that apply to Workers, allowing you to run more CPU-intensive tasks (up to 5 minutes of CPU time per instance), not including the time spent waiting on network calls, AI models, or other I/O bound tasks.

#### Human-in-the-loop

The new `step.waitForEvent` API allows a Workflow instance to wait on events and data, enabling human-in-the-the-loop interactions, such as approving or rejecting a request, directly handling webhooks from other systems, or pushing event data to a Workflow while it's running.

Because Workflows are just code, you can conditionally execute code based on the result of a `waitForEvent` call, and/or call `waitForEvent` multiple times in a single Workflow based on what the Workflow needs.

For example, if you wanted to implement a human-in-the-loop approval process, you could use `waitForEvent` to wait for a user to approve or reject a request, and then conditionally execute code based on the result.

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
import { Workflow, WorkflowEvent } from "cloudflare:workflows";

export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// Other steps in your Workflow
		let event = await step.waitForEvent<IncomingStripeWebhook>("receive invoice paid webhook from Stripe", { type: "stripe-webhook", timeout: "1 hour" })
		// Rest of your Workflow
	}
}
```

</TypeScriptExample>

You can then send a Workflow an event from an external service via HTTP or from within a Worker using the [Workers API](/workflows/build/workers-api/) for Workflows:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env) {
    const instanceId = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("instanceId")
    const webhookPayload = await req.json<Payload>()

    let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get(instanceId);
    // Send our event, with `type` matching the event type defined in
    // our step.waitForEvent call
    await instance.sendEvent({type: "stripe-webhook", payload: webhookPayload})

    return Response.json({
      status: await instance.status(),
    });
  },
};
```

</TypeScriptExample>
