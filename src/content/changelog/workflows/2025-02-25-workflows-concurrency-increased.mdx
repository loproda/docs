import { Render, PackageManagers, TypeScriptExample } from "~/components";

[Workflows](/workflows/) now supports up to 4,500 concurrent (running) instances, up from the previous limit of 100. This limit will continue to increase during the Workflows open beta. This increase applies to all users on the Workers Paid plan, and takes effect immediately.

Review the Workflows [limits documentation](/workflows/reference/limits) and/or dive into the [get started guide](/workflows/get-started/guide/) to start building on Workflows.
