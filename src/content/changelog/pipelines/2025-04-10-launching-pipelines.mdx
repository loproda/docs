[Cloudflare Pipelines](/pipelines) is now available in beta, to all users with a [Workers Paid](/workers/platform/pricing) plan.

Pipelines let you ingest high volumes of real time data, without managing the underlying infrastructure. A single pipeline can ingest up to 100 MB of data per second, via HTTP or from a [Worker](/workers). Ingested data is automatically batched, written to output files, and delivered to an [R2 bucket](/r2) in your account. You can use Pipelines to build a data lake of clickstream data, or to store events from a Worker.

Create your first pipeline with a single command:

```bash title="Create a pipeline"
$ npx wrangler@latest pipelines create my-clickstream-pipeline --r2-bucket my-bucket

ðŸŒ€ Authorizing R2 bucket "my-bucket"
ðŸŒ€ Creating pipeline named "my-clickstream-pipeline"
âœ… Successfully created pipeline my-clickstream-pipeline

ðŸŽ‰ You can now send data to your pipeline!

Send data to your pipeline's HTTP endpoint:
curl "https://0e00c5ff09b34d018152af98d06f5a1xvc.pipelines.cloudflare.com/" -d '[{ ...JSON_DATA... }]'

To send data to your pipeline from a Worker, add the following configuration to your config file:
{
  "pipelines": [
    {
      "pipeline": "my-clickstream-pipeline",
      "binding": "PIPELINE"
    }
  ]
}
```
