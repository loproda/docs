In [Cloudflare Terraform Provider](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare) versions 5.2.0 and above, dozens of resources now have proper drift detection. Before this fix, these resources would indicate they needed to be updated or replaced â€” even if there was no real change. Now, you can rely on your `terraform plan` to only show what resources are expected to change.
