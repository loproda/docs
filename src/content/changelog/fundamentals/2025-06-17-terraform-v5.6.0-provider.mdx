Earlier this year, we announced the launch of the new [Terraform v5 Provider](/changelog/2025-02-03-terraform-v5-provider/).
Unlike the earlier Terraform providers, v5 is automatically generated based on the OpenAPI Schemas for our REST APIs. Since
launch, we have seen an unexpectedly high number of [issues](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare)
reported by customers. These issues currently impact about 15% of resources. We have been working diligently to address
these issues across the company, and have released the v5.6.0 release which includes a number of bug fixes. Please keep an
eye on this changelog for more information about upcoming releases.

### Changes

- Broad fixes across resources with recurring diffs, including, but not limited to:
  - `cloudflare_zero_trust_access_identity_provider`
	- `cloudflare_zone`
- `cloudflare_page_rules` runtime panic when setting `cache_level` to `cache_ttl_by_status`
- Failure to serialize requests in `cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_config`
- Undocumented field 'priority' on `zone_lockdown` resource
- Missing importability for `cloudflare_zero_trust_device_default_profile_local_domain_fallback` and `cloudflare_account_subscription`
- New resources:
  - `cloudflare_schema_validation_operation_settings`
  - `cloudflare_schema_validation_schemas`
  - `cloudflare_schema_validation_settings`
  - `cloudflare_zero_trust_device_settings`
- Other bug fixes

For a more detailed look at all of the changes, see the
[changelog](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/releases/tag/v5.6.0) in GitHub.

If you have an unaddressed issue with the provider, we encourage you to check the
[open issues](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues) and open a new one if one does not already
exist for what you are experiencing.

### Upgrading

If you are evaluating a move from v4 to v5, please make use of the
[migration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/guides/version-5-upgrade). We have
provided automated migration scripts using Grit which simplify the transition, although these do not support implementations which
use Terraform modules, so customers making use of modules need to migrate manually. Please make use of `terraform plan` to test
your changes before applying, and let us know if you encounter any additional issues by reporting to our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare).
