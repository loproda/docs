In the [Cloudflare Terraform Provider](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare) versions 5.2.0 and above, sensitive properties of resources are redacted in logs. Sensitive properties in [Cloudflare's OpenAPI Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudflare/api-schemas/refs/heads/main/openapi.yaml) are now annotated with `x-sensitive: true`. This results in proper auto-generation of the corresponding Terraform resources, and prevents sensitive values from being shown when you run Terraform commands.

This issue affected [resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs) related to these products and features:

- Alerts and Audit Logs
- Device API
- DLP
- DNS
- Magic Visibility
- Magic WAN
- TLS Certs and Hostnames
- Tunnels
- Turnstile
- Workers
- Zaraz
