In [AutoRAG](/autorag/), you can now view your object's custom metadata in the response from [`/search`](/autorag/usage/workers-binding/) and [`/ai-search`](/autorag/usage/workers-binding/), and optionally add a `context` field in the custom metadata of an object to provide additional guidance for AI-generated answers.

You can add [custom metadata](/r2/api/workers/workers-api-reference/#r2putoptions) to an object when uploading it to your R2 bucket.

# Object's custom metadata in search responses

When you run a search, AutoRAG now returns any custom metadata associated with the object. This metadata appears in the response inside `attributes` then `file` , and can be used for downstream processing.

For example, the `attributes` section of your search response may look like:

```json
{
	"attributes": {
		"timestamp": 1750001460000,
		"folder": "docs/",
		"filename": "launch-checklist.md",
		"file": {
			"url": "https://wiki.company.com/docs/launch-checklist",
			"context": "A checklist for internal launch readiness, including legal, engineering, and marketing steps."
		}
	}
}
```

# Add a `context` field to guide LLM answers

When you include a custom metadata field named `context`, AutoRAG attaches that value to each chunk of the file. When you run an `/ai-search` query, this `context` is passed to the LLM and can be used as additional input when generating an answer.

We recommend using the `context` field to describe supplemental information you want the LLM to consider, such as a summary of the document or a source URL. If you have several different metadata attributes, you can join them together however you choose within the `context` string.

For example:

```json
{
	"context": "summary: 'Checklist for internal product launch readiness, including legal, engineering, and marketing steps.'; url: 'https://wiki.company.com/docs/launch-checklist'"
}
```

This gives you more control over how your content is interpreted, without requiring you to modify the original contents of the file.
