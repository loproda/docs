In [AutoRAG](/autorag/), you can now [filter](/autorag/configuration/metadata/) by an object's file name using the `filename` attribute, giving you more control over which files are searched for a given query.

This is useful when your application has already determined which files should be searched. For example, you might query a PostgreSQL database to get a list of files a user has access to based on their permissions, and then use that list to limit what AutoRAG retrieves.

For example, your search query may look like:

```js
const response = await env.AI.autorag("my-autorag").search({
	query: "what is the project deadline?",
	filters: {
		type: "eq",
		key: "filename",
		value: "project-alpha-roadmap.md",
	},
});
```

This allows you to connect your application logic with AutoRAG's retrieval process, making it easy to control what gets searched without needing to reindex or modify your data.
