You can now use CASB to find security misconfigurations in your AWS cloud environment using [Data Loss Prevention](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/).

You can also [connect your AWS compute account](/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/casb-integrations/aws-s3/#compute-account) to extract and scan your S3 buckets for sensitive data while avoiding egress fees. CASB will scan any objects that exist in the bucket at the time of configuration.
