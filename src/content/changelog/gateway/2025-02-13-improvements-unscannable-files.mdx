Gateway HTTP policies can now block files that are password-protected, compressed, or otherwise unscannable.

These unscannable files are now matched with the [Download and Upload File Types traffic selectors](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#download-and-upload-file-types) for HTTP policies:

<Render file="gateway/policies/unscannable-files" product="cloudflare-one" />

To get started inspecting and modifying behavior based on these and other rules, refer to [HTTP filtering](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/initial-setup/http/).
