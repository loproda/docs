[Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/) will now evaluate [Network (Layer 4) policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/) **before** [HTTP (Layer 7) policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/). This change preserves your existing security posture and does not affect which traffic is filtered — but it may impact how notifications are displayed to end users.

This change will roll out progressively between **July 14–18, 2025**. If you use HTTP policies, we recommend reviewing your configuration ahead of rollout to ensure the user experience remains consistent.

### Updated order of enforcement

**Previous order:**

1. DNS policies
2. HTTP policies
3. Network policies

**New order:**

1. DNS policies
2. **Network policies**
3. **HTTP policies**

### Action required: Review your Gateway HTTP policies

This change may affect block notifications. For example:

- You have an **HTTP policy** to block `example.com` and display a block page.
- You also have a **Network policy** to block `example.com` silently (no client notification).

With the new order, the Network policy will trigger first — and the user will no longer see the HTTP block page.

To ensure users still receive a block notification, you can:

- Add a client notification to your Network policy, or
- Use only the HTTP policy for that domain.

### Why we’re making this change

This update is based on user feedback and aims to:

- Create a more intuitive model by evaluating network-level policies before application-level policies.
- Minimize [526 connection errors](/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/error-526/#error-526-in-the-zero-trust-context) by verifying the network path to an origin before attempting to establish a decrypted TLS connection.
