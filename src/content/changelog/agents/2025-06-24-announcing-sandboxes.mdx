AI is supercharging app development for everyone, but we need a safe way to run untrusted, LLM-written code. We’re introducing [Sandboxes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/sandbox), which let your Worker run actual processes in a secure, container-based environment.

```ts
import { getSandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";
export { Sandbox } from "@cloudflare/sandbox";

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {
		const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, "my-sandbox");
		return sandbox.exec("ls", ["-la"]);
	},
};
```

### Methods

- `exec(command: string, args: string[], options?: { stream?: boolean })`:Execute a command in the sandbox.
- `gitCheckout(repoUrl: string, options: { branch?: string; targetDir?: string; stream?: boolean })`: Checkout a git repository in the sandbox.
- `mkdir(path: string, options: { recursive?: boolean; stream?: boolean })`: Create a directory in the sandbox.
- `writeFile(path: string, content: string, options: { encoding?: string; stream?: boolean })`: Write content to a file in the sandbox.
- `readFile(path: string, options: { encoding?: string; stream?: boolean })`: Read content from a file in the sandbox.
- `deleteFile(path: string, options?: { stream?: boolean })`: Delete a file from the sandbox.
- `renameFile(oldPath: string, newPath: string, options?: { stream?: boolean })`: Rename a file in the sandbox.
- `moveFile(sourcePath: string, destinationPath: string, options?: { stream?: boolean })`: Move a file from one location to another in the sandbox.
- `ping()`: Ping the sandbox.

Sandboxes are still experimental. We're using them to explore how isolated, container-like workloads might scale on Cloudflare — and to help define the developer experience around them.

You can try it today from your Worker, with just a few lines of code. Let us know what you build.
