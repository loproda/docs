#### `agents-sdk` -> `agents` <Badge text="Updated" variant="tip" size="small" />

üìù **We've renamed the Agents package to `agents`**!

If you've already been building with the Agents SDK, you can update your dependencies to use the new package name, and replace references to `agents-sdk` with `agents`:

```sh
# Install the new package
npm i agents
```

```sh
# Remove the old (deprecated) package
npm uninstall agents-sdk

# Find instances of the old package name in your codebase
grep -r 'agents-sdk' .
# Replace instances of the old package name with the new one
# (or use find-replace in your editor)
sed -i 's/agents-sdk/agents/g' $(grep -rl 'agents-sdk' .)
```

All future updates will be pushed to the new `agents` package, and the older package has been marked as deprecated.

#### Agents SDK updates <Badge text="New" variant="tip" size="small" />

We've added a number of big new features to the Agents SDK over the past few weeks, including:

- You can now set `cors: true` when using `routeAgentRequest` to return permissive default CORS headers to Agent responses.
- The regular client now syncs state on the agent (just like the React version).
- `useAgentChat` bug fixes for passing headers/credentials, including properly clearing cache on unmount.
- Experimental `/schedule` module with a prompt/schema for adding scheduling to your app (with evals!).
- Changed the internal `zod` schema to be compatible with the limitations of Google's Gemini models by removing the discriminated union, allowing you to use Gemini models with the scheduling API.

We've also fixed a number of bugs with state synchronization and the React hooks.

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
// via https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/examples/cross-domain
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {
    return (
      // Set { cors: true } to enable CORS headers.
      (await routeAgentRequest(request, env, { cors: true })) ||
      new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
    );
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

</TypeScriptExample>

#### Call Agent methods from your client code <Badge text="New" variant="tip" size="small" />

We've added a new [`@unstable_callable()`](/agents/api-reference/agents-api/) decorator for defining methods that can be called directly from clients. This allows you call methods from within your client code: you can call methods (with arguments) and get native JavaScript objects back.

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
// server.ts
import { unstable_callable, Agent, type StreamingResponse } from "agents";
import type { Env } from "../server";

 export class Rpc extends Agent<Env> {
   // Use the decorator to define a callable method
   @unstable_callable({
     description: "rpc test",
   })
   async getHistory() {
     return this.sql`SELECT * FROM history ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10`;
   }
}
```
```tsx
// client.tsx
const { call } = useAgent({ agent: "rpc" });

const fetchUserHistory = async () => {
    try {
        setLoading(true);
        // Call methods directly on the Agent!
        const result = await call("getHistory");
        addToast(`RPC result: ${result}`, "success");
    } catch (error) {
        addToast(`Error: ${error}`, "error");
    } finally {
        setLoading(false);
    }
};
```

</TypeScriptExample>

#### agents-starter <Badge text="Updated" variant="tip" size="small" />

We've fixed a number of small bugs in the [`agents-starter`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents-starter) project ‚Äî a real-time, chat-based example application with tool-calling & human-in-the-loop built using the Agents SDK. The starter has also been upgraded to use the latest [wrangler v4](/changelog/2025-03-13-wrangler-v4/) release.

If you're new to Agents, you can install and run the `agents-starter` project in two commands:

```sh
# Install it
$ npm create cloudflare@latest agents-starter -- --template="cloudflare/agents-starter"
# Run it
$ npm run start
```

You can use the starter as a template for your own Agents projects: open up `src/server.ts` and `src/client.tsx` to see how the Agents SDK is used.

#### More documentation <Badge text="Updated" variant="tip" size="small" />

We've heard your feedback on the Agents SDK documentation, and we're shipping more API reference material and usage examples, including:

- Expanded [API reference documentation](/agents/api-reference/), covering the methods and properties exposed by the Agents SDK, as well as more usage examples.
- More [Client API](/agents/api-reference/agents-api/#client-api) documentation that documents `useAgent`, `useAgentChat` and the new `@unstable_callable` RPC decorator exposed by the SDK.
- New documentation on how to [call agents](/agents/api-reference/calling-agents/) and (optionally) authenticate clients before they connect to your Agents.

Note that the Agents SDK is continually growing: the type definitions included in the SDK will always include the latest APIs exposed by the `agents` package.
