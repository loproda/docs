## Simplified Worker Deployments with our SDKs

We've simplified the programmatic deployment of Workers via our [Cloudflare SDKs](/fundamentals/api/reference/sdks/). This update abstracts away the low-level complexities of the `multipart/form-data` upload process, allowing you to focus on your code while we handle the deployment mechanics.

This new interface is available in:

- [cloudflare-typescript](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-typescript) (4.4.1)
- [cloudflare-python](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-python) (4.3.1)

For complete examples, see our guide on [programmatic Worker deployments](/workers/platform/infrastructure-as-code).

### The Old way: Manual API calls

Previously, deploying a Worker programmatically required manually constructing a `multipart/form-data` HTTP request, packaging your code and a separate `metadata.json` file. This was more complicated and verbose, and prone to formatting errors.

For example, here's how you would upload a Worker script previously with cURL:

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/workers/scripts/my-hello-world-script \
  -X PUT \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
  -F 'metadata={
        "main_module": "my-hello-world-script.mjs",
        "bindings": [
          {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "name": "MESSAGE",
            "text": "Hello World!"
          }
        ],
        "compatibility_date": "$today"
      };type=application/json' \
  -F 'my-hello-world-script.mjs=@-;filename=my-hello-world-script.mjs;type=application/javascript+module' <<EOF
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return new Response(env.MESSAGE, { status: 200 });
  }
};
EOF
```

### After: SDK interface

With the new SDK interface, you can now define your entire Worker configuration using a single, structured object.

This approach allows you to specify metadata like `main_module`, `bindings`, and `compatibility_date` as clearer properties directly alongside your script content. Our SDK takes this logical object and automatically constructs the complex multipart/form-data API request behind the scenes.

Here's how you can now programmatically deploy a Worker via the [`cloudflare-typescript` SDK](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-typescript)

<TypeScriptExample>
```ts
import Cloudflare from 'cloudflare';
import { toFile } from 'cloudflare/index';

// ... client setup, script content, etc.

const script = await client.workers.scripts.update(scriptName, {
  account_id: accountID,
  metadata: {
    main_module: scriptFileName,
    bindings: [],
  },
  files: {
    [scriptFileName]: await toFile(Buffer.from(scriptContent), scriptFileName, {
      type: 'application/javascript+module',
    }),
  },
});
```

</TypeScriptExample>

## Terraform provider improvements

We've also made several fixes and enhancements to the [Cloudflare Terraform provider](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare):

- Fixed the [`cloudflare_workers_script`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/workers_script) resource in Terraform, which previously was producing a diff even when there were no changes. Now, your `terraform plan` outputs will be cleaner and more reliable.
- Fixed the [`cloudflare_workers_for_platforms_dispatch_namespace`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/workers_for_platforms_dispatch_namespace), where the provider would attempt to recreate the namespace on a `terraform apply`. The resource now correctly reads its remote state, ensuring stability for production environments and CI/CD workflows.
- The [`cloudflare_workers_route`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/workers_route) resource now allows for the `script` property to be empty, null, or omitted to indicate that pattern should be negated for all scripts (see routes [docs](/workers/configuration/routing/routes)). You can now reserve a pattern or temporarily disable a Worker on a route without deleting the route definition itself.
- Using `primary_location_hint` in the [`cloudflare_d1_database`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/d1_database) resource will no longer always try to recreate. You can now safely change the location hint for a D1 database without causing a destructive operation.

## API improvements

We've also properly documented the [Workers Script And Version Settings](/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/subresources/script_and_version_settings) in our public OpenAPI spec and SDKs.
