import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

You can now create Python Workers which are executed via a cron trigger.

This is similar to how it's done in JavaScript Workers, simply define a scheduled event
listener in your Worker:

```python
from workers import handler

@handler
async def on_scheduled(event, env, ctx):
  print("cron processed")
```

Define a cron trigger configuration in your Wrangler configuration file:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[triggers]
# Schedule cron triggers:
# - At every 3rd minute
# - At 15:00 (UTC) on first day of the month
# - At 23:59 (UTC) on the last weekday of the month
crons = [ "*/3 * * * *", "0 15 1 * *", "59 23 LW * *" ]
```

</WranglerConfig>

Then test your new handler by using Wrangler with the `--test-scheduled` flag and
making a request to `/cdn-cgi/handler/scheduled?cron=*+*+*+*+*`:

```sh
npx wrangler dev --test-scheduled

curl "http://localhost:8787/cdn-cgi/handler/scheduled?cron=*+*+*+*+*"
```
