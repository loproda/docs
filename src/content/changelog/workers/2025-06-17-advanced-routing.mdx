import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

For those building [Single Page Applications (SPAs) on Workers](/workers/static-assets/routing/single-page-application/#advanced-routing-control), you can now explicitly define which routes invoke your Worker script in Wrangler configuration. The [`run_worker_first` config option](/workers/static-assets/binding/#run_worker_first) has now been expanded to accept an array of route patterns, allowing you to more granularly specify when your Worker script runs.

**Configuration example:**

<WranglerConfig>

```json
{
	"name": "my-spa-worker",
	"compatibility_date": "$today",
	"main": "./src/index.ts",
	"assets": {
		"directory": "./dist/",
		"not_found_handling": "single-page-application",
		"binding": "ASSETS",
		"run_worker_first": ["/api/*", "!/api/docs/*"]
	}
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

This new routing control was done in partnership with our community and customers who provided great feedback on [our public proposal](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/discussions/9143). Thank you to everyone who brought forward use-cases and feedback on the design!

### Prerequisites

To use advanced routing control with `run_worker_first`, you'll need:

- [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) v4.20.0 and above
- [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/get-started/) v1.7.0 and above
