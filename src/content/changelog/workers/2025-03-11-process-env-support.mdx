import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

You can now access [environment variables](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) and
[secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets/) on [`process.env`](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/process/#processenv)
when using the [`nodejs_compat` compatibility flag](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag).

```js
const apiClient = ApiClient.new({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
const LOG_LEVEL = process.env.LOG_LEVEL || "info";
```

In Node.js, environment variables are exposed via the global `process.env` object. Some libraries
assume that this object will be populated, and many developers may be used to accessing variables
in this way.

Previously, the `process.env` object was always empty unless written to in Worker code. This could
cause unexpected errors or friction when developing Workers using code previously written for Node.js.

Now, [environment variables](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/),
[secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets/), and [version metadata](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/version-metadata/)
can all be accessed on `process.env`.

To opt-in to the new `process.env` behaviour now, add the [`nodejs_compat_populate_process_env`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#enable-auto-populating-processenv) compatibility flag to your
`wrangler.json` configuration:

<WranglerConfig>

```jsonc
{
	// Rest of your configuration
	// Add "nodejs_compat_populate_process_env" to your compatibility_flags array
	"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat", "nodejs_compat_populate_process_env"],
	// Rest of your configuration
```

</WranglerConfig>

After April 1, 2025, populating `process.env` will become the default behavior when both `nodejs_compat` is enabled and
your Worker's `compatibility_date` is after "2025-04-01".
