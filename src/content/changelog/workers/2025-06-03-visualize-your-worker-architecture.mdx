import { Render } from "~/components";

You can now visualize, explore and modify your Workerâ€™s architecture directly in the Cloudflare dashboard, making it easier to understand how your application connects to Cloudflare resources like [D1 databases](/d1), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects), [KV namespaces](/kv), and [more](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/).

![Bindings canvas](src/assets/images/changelog/workers/bindings-canvas.png)

With this new view, you can easily:

- Explore existing bindings in a visual, architecture-style diagram
- Add and manage bindings directly from the same interface
- Discover the full range of compute, storage, AI, and media resources you can attach to your Workers application.

To get started, head to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages) and open the **Bindings** tab of any Workers application.
