You can now grant members of your Cloudflare account read-only access to the Workers
Platform.

The new "Workers Platform (Read-only)" role grants read-only access to all products typically used as part of Cloudflare's Developer Platform, including [Workers](/workers/), [Pages](/pages/), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/), [KV](/kv/), [R2](/r2/), Zones, [Zone Analytics](/analytics/account-and-zone-analytics/zone-analytics/) and [Page Rules](/rules/). When Cloudflare introduces new products to the Workers platform, we will add additional read-only permissions to this role.

Additionally, the role previously named "Workers Admin" has been renamed to "Workers Platform Admin". This
change ensures that the name more accurately reflects the permissions granted — this
role has always granted access to more than just
Workers — it grants read and write access to the products mentioned above, and similarly, as new products are added to the Workers platform, we will add additional read and write permissions to this role.

You can review the updated roles in the [developer docs](/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/).
