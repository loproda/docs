The [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/) has [reached v1.0](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-vite-plugin) and is now Generally Available ("GA").

When you use `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`, you can use Vite's local development server and build tooling, while ensuring that while developing, your code runs in [`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), the open-source Workers runtime.

This lets you get the best of both worlds for a full-stack app — you can use [Hot Module Replacement](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) from Vite right alongside [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/) and other runtime APIs and bindings that are unique to Cloudflare Workers.

`@cloudflare/vite-plugin` is made possible by the new [environment API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-environment) in Vite, and was built [in partnership with the Vite team](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-vite-plugin).

#### Framework support

You can build any type of application with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`, using any rendering mode, from single page applications (SPA) and static sites to server-side rendered (SSR) pages and API routes.

[React Router v7 (Remix)](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/) is the first full-stack framework to provide full support for Cloudflare Vite plugin, allowing you to use all parts of Cloudflare's developer platform, without additional build steps.

You can also build complete full-stack apps on Workers **without a framework** — ["just use Vite"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-vite-plugin) and React together, and build a back-end API in the same Worker. Follow our [React SPA with an API tutorial](/workers/vite-plugin/tutorial/) to learn how.

#### Configuration

If you're already using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) in your build and development toolchain, you can start using our plugin with minimal changes to your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { cloudflare } from "@cloudflare/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [cloudflare()],
});
```
