In Cloudflare Workers, you can now attach an event listener to [`Request`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/) objects, using the [`signal` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/signal). This allows you to perform tasks when the request to your Worker is canceled by the client. To use this feature, you must set the [`enable_request_signal`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#enable-requestsignal-for-incoming-requests) compatibility flag.

You can use a listener to perform cleanup tasks or write to logs before your Worker's invocation ends. For example, if you run the Worker below, and then abort the request from the client, a log will be written:

<Render file="request-signal-example" product="workers" />

For more information see the [`Request` documentation](/workers/runtime-apis/request).
