We’ve increased the total allowed size of [`blob`](/analytics/analytics-engine/get-started/#2-write-data-points-from-your-worker) fields on data points written to [Workers Analytics Engine](/analytics/analytics-engine/) from **5 KB to 16 KB**.

This change gives you more flexibility when logging rich observability data — such as base64-encoded payloads, AI inference traces, or custom metadata — without hitting request size limits.

You can find full details on limits for queries, filters, payloads, and more [here in the Workers Analytics Engine limits documentation](/analytics/analytics-engine/limits/).

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts title="worker.ts"
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		env.analyticsDataset.writeDataPoint({
			// The sum of all of the blob's sizes can now be 16 KB
			blobs: [
				// The URL of the request to the Worker
				request.url,
				// Some metadata about your application you'd like to store
				JSON.stringify(metadata),
				// The version of your Worker this datapoint was collected from
				env.versionMetadata.tag,
			],
			indexes: ["sample-index"],
		});
	}
};
```

</TypeScriptExample>
