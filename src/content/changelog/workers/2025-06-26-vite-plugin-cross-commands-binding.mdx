Workers can now talk to each other across separate dev commands using service bindings and tail consumers, whether started with `vite dev` or `wrangler dev`.

Simply start each Worker in its own terminal:

```sh
# Terminal 1
vite dev

# Terminal 2
wrangler dev
```

This is useful when different teams maintain different Workers, or when each Worker has its own build setup or tooling.

Check out the [Developing with multiple Workers](/workers/development-testing/multi-workers) guide to learn more about the different approaches and when to use each one.
