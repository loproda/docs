As part of the ongoing open beta for [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds/), we’ve increased the available disk space for builds from **8 GB** to **20 GB** for both Free and Paid plans. 

This provides more space for larger projects, dependencies, and build artifacts while improving overall build reliability.

| Metric     | Free Plan | Paid Plans |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Disk Space | 20 GB     | 20 GB      |

All other [build limits](/workers/ci-cd/builds/limits-and-pricing/) — including CPU, memory, build minutes, and timeout remain unchanged.
