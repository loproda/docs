By setting the value of the `cache` property to `no-cache`, you can force [Cloudflare's
cache](/workers/reference/how-the-cache-works/) to revalidate its contents with the origin when
making subrequests from [Cloudflare Workers](/workers).

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
export default {
  async fetch(req, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		const request = new Request("https://cloudflare.com", { cache: 'no-cache'});
		const response = await fetch(request);
    return response;
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Environment>
```
</TypeScriptExample>

When `no-cache` is set, the Worker request will first look for a match in Cloudflare's cache, then:

- If there is a match, a conditional request is sent to the origin, regardless of whether or not the match is fresh or stale. If the resource has not changed, the
  cached version is returned. If the resource has changed, it will be downloaded from the origin, updated in the cache, and returned.
- If there is no match, Workers will make a standard request to the origin and cache the response.

This increases compatibility with NPM packages and JavaScript frameworks that rely on setting the
[`cache`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/#options) property, which is a cross-platform standard part
of the [`Request`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/) interface. Previously, if you set the `cache`
property on `Request` to `'no-cache'`, the Workers runtime threw an exception.
