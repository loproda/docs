The following full-stack frameworks now have Generally Available ("GA") adapters for Cloudflare Workers, and are ready for you to use in production:

- [React Router v7 (Remix)](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/)
- [Astro](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/astro/)
- [Hono](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/more-web-frameworks/hono/)
- [Vue.js](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/vue/)
- [Nuxt](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/more-web-frameworks/nuxt/)
- [Svelte (SvelteKit)](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/svelte/)
- And [more](/workers/framework-guides/).

The following frameworks are now in **beta**, with GA support coming very soon:

- [Next.js](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/nextjs/), supported through [@opennextjs/cloudflare](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) is now `v1.0-beta`.
- [Angular](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/more-web-frameworks/angular/)
- [SolidJS (SolidStart)](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/more-web-frameworks/solid/)

You can also build complete full-stack apps on Workers **without a framework**:

- You can [â€œjust use Vite"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-vite-plugin) and React together, and build a back-end API in the same Worker. Follow our [React SPA with an API tutorial](/workers/vite-plugin/tutorial/) to learn how.

**Get started building today with our [framework guides](/workers/framework-guides/)**, or read our [Developer Week 2025 blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/full-stack-development-on-cloudflare-workers) about all the updates to building full-stack applications on Workers.
