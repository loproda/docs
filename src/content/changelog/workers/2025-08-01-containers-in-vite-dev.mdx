import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

You can now configure and run [Containers](/containers) alongside your [Worker](/workers) during local development when using the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/). Previously, you could only develop locally when using [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/) as your local development server.

#### Configuration

You can simply configure your Worker and your Container(s) in your Wrangler configuration file:

<WranglerConfig>
```jsonc
{
  "name": "container-starter",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "containers": [
    {
      "class_name": "MyContainer",
      "image": "./Dockerfile",
      "instances": 5
    }
  ],
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "class_name": "MyContainer",
        "name": "MY_CONTAINER"
      }
    ]
  },
  "migrations": [
    {
      "new_sqlite_classes": [
        "MyContainer"
      ],
      "tag": "v1"
    }
  ],
}
```
</WranglerConfig>

#### Worker Code

Once your Worker and Containers are configured, you can access the Container instances from your Worker code:

```ts
import { Container, getContainer } from "@cloudflare/containers";

export class MyContainer extends Container {
  defaultPort = 4000; // Port the container is listening on
  sleepAfter = "10m"; // Stop the instance if requests not sent for 10 minutes
}

async fetch(request, env) {
  const { "session-id": sessionId } = await request.json();
  // Get the container instance for the given session ID
  const containerInstance = getContainer(env.MY_CONTAINER, sessionId)
  // Pass the request to the container instance on its default port
  return containerInstance.fetch(request);
}
```

#### Local development

To develop your Worker locally, start a local dev server by running

```sh
vite dev
```

in your terminal.
