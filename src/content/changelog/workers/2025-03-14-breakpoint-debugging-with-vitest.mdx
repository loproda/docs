You can now debug your Workers tests with our [Vitest integration](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/) by running the following command:

```sh
vitest --inspect --no-file-parallelism
```

Attach a debugger to the port 9229 and you can start stepping through your Workers tests. This is available with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` v0.7.5 or later.

Learn more in our [documentation](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/debugging/).
