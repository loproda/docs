The [Workers Observability dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/observability/) offers a single place to investigate and explore your [Workers Logs](/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs).

The **Overview** tab shows logs from all your Workers in one place. The **Invocations** view groups logs together by invocation, which refers to the specific trigger that started the execution of the Worker (i.e. fetch). The **Events** view shows logs in the order they were produced, based on timestamp. Previously, you could only view logs for a single Worker.

The **Investigate** tab presents a Query Builder, which helps you write structured queries to investigate and visualize your logs. The Query Builder can help answer questions such as:
- Which paths are experiencing the most 5XX errors?
- What is the wall time distribution by status code for my Worker?
- What are the slowest requests, and where are they coming from?
- Who are my top N users?

The Query Builder can use any field that you store in your logs as a key to visualize, filter, and group by. Use the Query Builder to quickly access your data, build visualizations, save queries, and share them with your team.

### Workers Logs is now Generally Available

[Workers Logs](/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs) is now Generally Available. With a [small change](/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#enable-workers-logs) to your Wrangler configuration, Workers Logs ingests, indexes, and stores all logs emitted from your Workers for up to 7 days.

We've introduced a number of changes during our beta period, including:
- Dashboard enhancements with customizable fields as columns in the Logs view and support for invocation-based grouping
- Performance improvements to ensure no adverse impact
- Public [API endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workers/subresources/observability/) for broader consumption

The API documents three endpoints: list the keys in the telemetry dataset, run a query, and list the unique values for a key. For more, visit our [REST API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workers/subresources/observability/).

Visit the [docs](/workers/observability/query-builder) to learn more about the capabilities and methods exposed by the Query Builder. Start using Workers Logs and the Query Builder today by enabling observability for your Workers:

<WranglerConfig>
	```toml
	[observability]
	enabled = true

	[observability.logs]
	invocation_logs = true
	head_sampling_rate = 1 # optional. default = 1.
	```
</WranglerConfig>
