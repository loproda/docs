[Log Explorer](/log-explorer/) is now GA, providing native observability and forensics for traffic flowing through Cloudflare.

Search and analyze your logs, natively in the Cloudflare dashboard. These logs are also stored in Cloudflare's network, eliminating many of the costs associated with other log providers.
