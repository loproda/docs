Cloudflare Registrar now supports `.ai` and `.shop` domains. These are two of our most highly-requested top-level domains (TLDs) and are great additions to the [300+ other TLDs we support](https://domains.cloudflare.com/tlds).

Starting today, customers can:

- Register and renew these domains _at cost_ without any markups or add-on fees
- Enjoy best-in-class security and performance with native integrations with Cloudflare DNS, CDN, and SSL services like one-click DNSSEC
- Combat domain hijacking with [Custom Domain Protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/custom-domain-protection/) (available on enterprise plans)

We can't wait to see what AI and e-commerce projects you deploy on Cloudflare. To get started, transfer your domains to Cloudflare or [search for new ones to register](https://domains.cloudflare.com/).
