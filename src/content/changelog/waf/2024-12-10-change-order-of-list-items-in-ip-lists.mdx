Due to changes in the API implementation, the order of list items in an IP list obtained via API or Terraform may change, which may cause Terraform to detect a change in Terraform state. To fix this issue, resync the Terraform state or upgrade the version of your Terraform Cloudflare provider to [version 4.44.0](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/releases/tag/v4.44.0) or later.
