We're thrilled to be a Day 0 partner with [OpenAI](http://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss) to bring their [latest open models](https://openai.com/index/gpt-oss-model-card/) to Workers AI, including support for Responses API, Code Interpreter, and Web Search (coming soon).

Get started with the new models at `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b` and `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-20b`.
Check out the [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/openai-gpt-oss-on-workers-ai) for more details about the new models, and the [`gpt-oss-120b`](/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-120b) and [`gpt-oss-20b`](/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-20b) model pages for more information about pricing and context windows.

## Responses API
If you call the model through:
- Workers Binding, it will accept/return Responses API – `env.AI.run(“@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b”)`
- REST API on `/run` endpoint, it will accept/return Responses API – `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/ai/run/@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- REST API on new `/responses` endpoint, it will accept/return Responses API – `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/ai/v1/responses`
- REST API for OpenAI Compatible endpoint, it will return Chat Completions (coming soon) – `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/ai/v1/chat/completions`


```
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/ai/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "medium"},
    "input": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What are the benefits of open-source models?"
      }
    ]
  }'


```

## Code Interpreter
The model is natively trained to support stateful code execution, and we've implemented support for this feature using our [Sandbox SDK](https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox-sdk) and [Containers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/containers-are-available-in-public-beta-for-simple-global-and-programmable/). Cloudflare's Developer Platform is uniquely positioned to support this feature, so we're very excited to bring our products together to support this new use case.

## Web Search (coming soon)
We are working to implement Web Search for the model, where users can bring their own Exa API Key so the model can browse the Internet.
