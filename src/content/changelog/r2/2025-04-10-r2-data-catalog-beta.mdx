Today, we're launching [R2 Data Catalog](/r2/data-catalog/) in open beta, a managed Apache Iceberg catalog built directly into your [Cloudflare R2](/r2/) bucket.

If you're not already familiar with it, [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) is an open table format designed to handle large-scale analytics datasets stored in object storage, offering ACID transactions and schema evolution. R2 Data Catalog exposes a standard Iceberg REST catalog interface, so you can connect engines like [Spark](/r2/data-catalog/config-examples/spark-scala/), [Snowflake](/r2/data-catalog/config-examples/snowflake/), and [PyIceberg](/r2/data-catalog/config-examples/pyiceberg/) to start querying your tables using the tools you already know.

To enable a data catalog on your R2 bucket, find **R2 Data Catalog** in your buckets settings in the dashboard, or run:

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket catalog enable my-bucket
```

And that's it. You'll get a catalog URI and warehouse you can plug into your favorite Iceberg engines.

Visit our [getting started guide](/r2/data-catalog/get-started/) for step-by-step instructions on enabling R2 Data Catalog, creating tables, and running your first queries.
