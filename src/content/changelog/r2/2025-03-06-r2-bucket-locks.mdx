You can now use [bucket locks](/r2/buckets/bucket-locks/) to set retention policies on your [R2 buckets](/r2/buckets/) (or specific prefixes within your buckets) for a specified period â€” or indefinitely. This can help ensure compliance by protecting important data from accidental or malicious deletion.

Locks give you a few ways to ensure your objects are retained (not deleted or overwritten). You can:

- Lock objects for a specific duration, for example 90 days.
- Lock objects until a certain date, for example January 1, 2030.
- Lock objects indefinitely, until the lock is explicitly removed.

Buckets can have up to 1,000 [bucket lock rules](/r2/buckets/). Each rule specifies which objects it covers (via prefix) and how long those objects must remain retained.

Here are a couple of examples showing how you can configure bucket lock rules using [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/):

#### Ensure all objects in a bucket are retained for at least 180 days

```sh
npx wrangler r2 bucket lock add <bucket> --name 180-days-all --retention-days 180
```

#### Prevent deletion or overwriting of all logs indefinitely (via prefix)

```sh
npx wrangler r2 bucket lock add <bucket> --name indefinite-logs --prefix logs/ --retention-indefinite
```

For more information on bucket locks and how to set retention policies for objects in your R2 buckets, refer to our [documentation](/r2/buckets/bucket-locks/).
