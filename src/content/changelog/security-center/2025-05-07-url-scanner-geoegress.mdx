Enterprise customers can now choose the geographic location from which a URL scan is performed — either via [Security Center](/security-center/investigate/) in the Cloudflare dashboard or via the [URL Scanner API](/api/resources/url_scanner/subresources/scans/methods/create/).

This feature gives security teams greater insight into how a website behaves across different regions, helping uncover targeted, location-specific threats.

**What’s new:**

- Location Picker: Select a location for the scan via **Security Center → Investigate** in the dashboard or through the API.
- Region-aware scanning: Understand how content changes by location — useful for detecting regionally tailored attacks.
- Default behavior: If no location is set, scans default to the user’s current geographic region.

Learn more in the [Security Center documentation](/security-center/).
