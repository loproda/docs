A new GA release for the iOS Cloudflare One Agent is now available in the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cloudflare-one-agent/id6443476492). This release
contains improvements and new exciting features, including [post-quantum cryptography](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/#enable_post_quantum).
By tunneling your corporate network traffic over Cloudflare, you can now gain the immediate [protection of post-quantum cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/) without needing to upgrade any of your individual corporate applications or systems.

**Changes and improvements**

- QLogs are now disabled by default and can be enabled in the app by turning on **Enable qlogs** under **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Diagnostics** > **Debug Logs**. The QLog setting from previous releases will no longer be respected.
- DNS over HTTPS traffic is now included in the WARP tunnel by default.
- The WARP client now applies [post-quantum cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/) end-to-end on enabled devices accessing resources behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. This feature can be enabled by [MDM](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/#enable_post_quantum).
