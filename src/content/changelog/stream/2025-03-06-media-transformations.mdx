Today, we are thrilled to announce Media Transformations, a new service that
brings the magic of [Image Transformations](/images/transform-images/) to
_short-form video files,_ wherever they are stored!

For customers with a huge volume of short video — generative AI output,
e-commerce product videos, social media clips, or short marketing content —
uploading those assets to Stream is not always practical. Sometimes, the
greatest friction to getting started was the thought of all that migrating.
Customers want a simpler solution that retains their current storage strategy to
deliver small, optimized MP4 files. Now you can do that with Media
Transformations.

To transform a video or image,
[enable transformations](/stream/transform-videos/#getting-started) for your
zone, then make a simple request with a specially formatted URL. The result is
an MP4 that can be used in an HTML video element without a player library.
If your zone already has Image Transformations enabled, then it is ready to
optimize videos with Media Transformations, too.

For example, we have a short video of the mobile in Austin's office. The
original is nearly 30 megabytes and wider than necessary for this layout.
Consider a simple width adjustment:

<video controls>
	<source src="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/media/width=640/https://pub-d9fcbc1abcd244c1821f38b99017347f.r2.dev/aus-mobile.mp4" />
</video>

```text title="Example URL"
https://example.com/cdn-cgi/media/width=640/<SOURCE-VIDEO>
https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/media/width=640/https://pub-d9fcbc1abcd244c1821f38b99017347f.r2.dev/aus-mobile.mp4
```

The result is less than 3 megabytes, properly sized, and delivered dynamically
so that customers do not have to manage the creation and storage of these
transformed assets.
