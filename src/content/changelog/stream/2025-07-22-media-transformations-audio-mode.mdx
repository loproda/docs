We now support `audio` mode! Use this feature to extract audio from a source video, outputting
an M4A file to use in downstream workflows like [AI inference](/workers-ai/), content moderation, or transcription.

For example,

``` text title="Example URL"
https://example.com/cdn-cgi/media/<OPTIONS>/<SOURCE-VIDEO>
https://example.com/cdn-cgi/media/mode=audio,time=3s,duration=60s/<input video with diction>
```
