Hyperdrive now supports more SSL/TLS security options for your database connections:

- Configure Hyperdrive to verify server certificates with `verify-ca` or `verify-full` SSL modes and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks
- Configure Hyperdrive to provide client certificates to the database server to authenticate itself (mTLS) for stronger security beyond username and password

Use the new `wrangler cert` commands to create certificate authority (CA) certificate bundles or client certificate pairs:

```bash
# Create CA certificate bundle
npx wrangler cert upload certificate-authority --ca-cert your-ca-cert.pem --name your-custom-ca-name

# Create client certificate pair
npx wrangler cert upload mtls-certificate --cert client-cert.pem --key client-key.pem --name your-client-cert-name
```

Then create a Hyperdrive configuration with the certificates and desired SSL mode:

```bash
npx wrangler hyperdrive create your-hyperdrive-config \
  --connection-string="postgres://user:password@hostname:port/database" \
  --ca-certificate-id <CA_CERT_ID> \
  --mtls-certificate-id <CLIENT_CERT_ID>
  --sslmode verify-full
```
