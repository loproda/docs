You can now specify the number of connections your Hyperdrive configuration uses to connect to your origin database.

All configurations have a minimum of 5 connections. The maximum connection count for a Hyperdrive configuration depends on the [Hyperdrive limits of your Workers plan](/hyperdrive/platform/limits/).

This feature allows you to right-size your connection pool based on your database capacity and application requirements. You can configure connection counts through the Cloudflare dashboard or API.

Refer to the [Hyperdrive configuration documentation](/hyperdrive/configuration/connection-pooling/) for more information.
