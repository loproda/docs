You can now locally configure your [Magic WAN Connector](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/) to work in a static IP configuration.

This local method does not require having access to a DHCP Internet connection. However, it does require being comfortable with using tools to access the serial port on Magic WAN Connector as well as using a serial terminal client to access the Connector's environment.

For more details, refer to [WAN with a static IP address](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/configure-hardware-connector/#bootstrap-via-serial-console).
