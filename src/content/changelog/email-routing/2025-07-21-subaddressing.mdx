Subaddressing, as defined in [RFC 5233](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5233), also known as plus addressing, is now supported in Email Routing. This enables using the "+" separator to augment your custom addresses with arbitrary detail information.

Now you can send an email to `user+detail@example.com` and it will be captured by the `user@example.com` custom address. The `+detail` part is ignored by Email Routing, but it can be captured next in the processing chain in the logs, an [Email Worker](/email-routing/email-workers/) or an [Agent application](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/examples/email-agent).

Customers can use this feature to dynamically add context to their emails, such as tracking the source of an email or categorizing emails without needing to create multiple custom addresses.
