Cloudflare now allows you to send SSH command logs to storage destinations configured in [Logpush](/logs/logpush/), including third-party destinations. Once exported, analyze and audit the data as best fits your organization! For a list of available data fields, refer to the [SSH logs dataset](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/ssh_logs/).

To set up a Logpush job, refer to [Logpush integration](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/).
