Organizations can now eliminate long-lived credentials from their SSH setup and enable strong multi-factor authentication for SSH access, similar to other Access applications, all while generating access and command logs.

SSH with [Access for Infrastructure](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/) uses short-lived SSH certificates from Cloudflare, eliminating SSH key management and reducing the security risks associated with lost or stolen keys. It also leverages a common deployment model for Cloudflare One customers: [WARP-to-Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/ssh-warp-to-tunnel/).

SSH with Access for Infrastructure enables you to:

- **Author fine-grained policy** to control who may access your SSH servers, including specific ports, protocols, and SSH users.
- **Monitor infrastructure access** with Access and SSH command logs, supporting regulatory compliance and providing visibility in case of security breach.
- **Preserve your end users' workflows.** SSH with Access for Infrastructure supports native SSH clients and does not require any modifications to usersâ€™ SSH configs.
