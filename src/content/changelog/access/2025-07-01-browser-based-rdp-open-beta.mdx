[Browser-based RDP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/rdp/rdp-browser/) with [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) is now available in open beta for all Cloudflare customers. It enables secure, remote Windows server access without VPNs or RDP clients.

With browser-based RDP, you can:

- **Control how users authenticate to internal RDP resources** with single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and granular access policies.
- **Record who is accessing which servers and when** to support regulatory compliance requirements and to gain greater visibility in the event of a security event.
- **Eliminate the need to install and manage software on user devices**. You will only need a web browser.
- **Reduce your attack surface** by keeping your RDP servers off the public Internet and protecting them from common threats like credential stuffing or brute-force attacks.
