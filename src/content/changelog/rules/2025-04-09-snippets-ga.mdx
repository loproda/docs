[Cloudflare Snippets](/rules/snippets/) are now generally available at no extra cost across all paid plans — giving you a fast, flexible way to programmatically control HTTP traffic using lightweight JavaScript.

You can now use Snippets to modify HTTP requests and responses with confidence, reliability, and scale. Snippets are production-ready and deeply integrated with Cloudflare Rules, making them ideal for everything from quick dynamic header rewrites to advanced routing logic.

What's new:

- **Snippets are now GA** – Available at no extra cost on all Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans.
- **Ready for production** – Snippets deliver a production-grade experience built for scale.
- **Part of the Cloudflare Rules platform** – Snippets inherit request modifications from other Cloudflare products and support sequential execution, allowing you to run multiple Snippets on the same request and apply custom modifications step by step.
- **Trace integration** – Use [Cloudflare Trace](/rules/trace-request/) to see which Snippets were triggered on a request — helping you understand traffic flow and debug more effectively.
