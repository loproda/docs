You can now use the [`cf.worker.upstream_zone`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.worker.upstream_zone/) field in [Transform Rules](/rules/transform/) to control rule execution based on whether a request originates from [Workers](/workers/), including subrequests issued by Workers in other zones.

**What's new:**
- `cf.worker.upstream_zone` is now supported in Transform Rules expressions.
- Skip or apply logic conditionally when handling [Workers subrequests](/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests).

For example, to add a header when the subrequest comes from another zone:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor** (replace `myappexample.com` with your domain):

```txt
(cf.worker.upstream_zone != "" and cf.worker.upstream_zone != "myappexample.com")
```

Selected operation under **Modify request header**: _Set static_

**Header name**: `X-External-Workers-Subrequest`

**Value**: `1`

</Example>

This gives you more granular control in how you handle incoming requests for your zone.
