You can now use IP, Autonomous System (AS), and Hostname [custom lists](/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/) to route traffic to [Snippets](/rules/snippets/) and [Cloud Connector](/rules/cloud-connector/), giving you greater precision and control over how you match and process requests at the edge.

In Snippets, you can now also match on [Bot Score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) and [WAF Attack Score](/waf/detections/attack-score/), unlocking smarter edge logic for everything from request filtering and mitigation to [tarpitting](/rules/snippets/examples/slow-suspicious-requests/) and logging.

**What’s new:**

- [Custom lists](/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/) matching – Snippets and Cloud Connector now support user-created IP, AS, and Hostname lists via dashboard or [Lists API](/api/resources/rules/subresources/lists/methods/list/). Great for shared logic across zones.
- [Bot Score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) and [WAF Attack Score](/waf/detections/attack-score/) – Use Cloudflare’s intelligent traffic signals to detect bots or attacks and take advanced, tailored actions with just a few lines of code.
