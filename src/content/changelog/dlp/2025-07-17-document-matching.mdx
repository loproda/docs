You can now create [document-based](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/detection-entries/#documents) detection entries in DLP by uploading example documents. Cloudflare will encrypt your documents and create a unique fingerprint of the file. This fingerprint is then used to identify similar documents or snippets within your organization's traffic and stored files.

**Key features and benefits:**

- **Upload documents, forms, or templates:** Easily upload .docx and .txt files (up to 10 MB) that contain sensitive information you want to protect.

- **Granular control with similarity percentage:** Define a minimum similarity percentage (0-100%) that a document must meet to trigger a detection, reducing false positives.

- **Comprehensive coverage:** Apply these document-based detection entries in:

    - **Gateway policies:** To inspect network traffic for sensitive documents as they are uploaded or shared.

    - **CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker):** To scan files stored in cloud applications for sensitive documents at rest.

- **Identify sensitive data:** This new detection entry type is ideal for identifying sensitive data within completed forms, templates, or even small snippets of a larger document, helping you prevent data exfiltration and ensure compliance.

Once uploaded and processed, you can add this new document entry into a DLP profile and policies to enhance your data protection strategy.
