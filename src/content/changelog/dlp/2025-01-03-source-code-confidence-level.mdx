You can now detect source code leaks with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) with predefined checks against common programming languages.

DLP also supports confidence level for [source code profiles](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/predefined-profiles/#source-code).

For more details, refer to [DLP profiles](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/).
